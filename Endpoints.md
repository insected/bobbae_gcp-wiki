[Cloud Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/) is an API management system that helps you secure, monitor, analyze, and set quotas on your APIs using the same infrastructure Google uses for its own APIs. After you deploy your API to Endpoints, you can use the Cloud Endpoints Portal to create a developer portal, a website that users of your API can access to view documentation and interact with your API.


To have your API managed by Cloud Endpoints, you have three options, depending on where your API is hosted and the type of communications protocol your API uses:

- Cloud Endpoints for OpenAPI
- Cloud Endpoints for [gRPC](GRPC)
- Cloud Endpoints Frameworks for the App Engine standard environment

## Choosing Endpoints options

## OpenAPI

Cloud Endpoints is an [API management system](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/openapi) that helps you secure, monitor, analyze, and set quotas on your APIs using the same infrastructure Google uses for its own APIs. Endpoints works with the Extensible Service Proxy (ESP) and the Extensible Service Proxy V2 (ESPv2) to provide API management. You can find out more about Endpoints, ESP, and ESPv2 in About Endpoints.





## App Engine Standard

[Cloud Endpoints Frameworks](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/frameworks/about-cloud-endpoints-frameworks) is a web framework for the App Engine standard Python 2.7 and Java 8 runtime environments. Cloud Endpoints Frameworks provides the tools and libraries that allow you to generate REST APIs and client libraries for your application.
