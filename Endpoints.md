Cloud Endpoints is an API management system that helps you secure, monitor, analyze, and set quotas on your APIs using the same infrastructure Google uses for its own APIs. After you deploy your API to Endpoints, you can use the Cloud Endpoints Portal to create a developer portal, a website that users of your API can access to view documentation and interact with your API.

## OpenAPI

Cloud Endpoints is an API management system that helps you secure, monitor, analyze, and set quotas on your APIs using the same infrastructure Google uses for its own APIs. Endpoints works with the Extensible Service Proxy (ESP) and the Extensible Service Proxy V2 (ESPv2) to provide API management. You can find out more about Endpoints, ESP, and ESPv2 in About Endpoints.

## GRPC

gRPC is a high performance, open-source universal RPC framework, developed by Google. In gRPC, a client application can directly call methods on a server application on a different machine as if it was a local object, making it easier to create distributed applications and services.

One of the primary benefits of using gRPC is for documentation; you can use your service configuration and API interface definition files to generate reference documentation for your API. 

With Endpoints for gRPC, you can use the API management capabilities of Endpoints to add an API console, monitoring, hosting, tracing, authentication, and more to your gRPC services. In addition, once you specify special mapping rules, ESP and ESPv2 translate RESTful JSON over HTTP into gRPC requests. This means that you can deploy a gRPC server managed by Endpoints and call its API using a gRPC or JSON/HTTP client, giving you much more flexibility and ease of integration with other systems.

## App Engine Standard

Cloud Endpoints Frameworks is a web framework for the App Engine standard Python 2.7 and Java 8 runtime environments. Cloud Endpoints Frameworks provides the tools and libraries that allow you to generate REST APIs and client libraries for your application.
