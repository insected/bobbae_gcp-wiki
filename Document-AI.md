Use machine learning on a single cloud-based platform to automatically classify, extract, and enrich data within your documents to unlock insights. To learn more about Document AI, see Document AI basics.

Using Document AI, you can:

- Convert images to text
- Classify documents
- Analyze and extract entities

Document AI release features:

- General processors - Document OCR (Optical Character Recognition), Form parser, and Document splitter.

## Human in the Loop

HITL AI enables human verification and corrections to ensure accuracy of data extracted by Human in the Loop processors before it is used in critical business applications. It provides a workflow and UI for humans (referred to as labelers in HITL) to review, validate and correct the data extracted from documents by Human in the Loop processors. It is used across Financial Services, Health, Manufacturing, Government and other industries.

HITL AI offers the following benefits:

- Risk mitigation - mitigate financial risks of critical data being incorrect - for example, invoice amounts, billing addresses, loan amounts, etc.
- Simplify Exception Handling - Easily roll out a human review and exception handling workflow.
- Workforce Efficiencies - manage, monitor and improve productivity of workforce managing human review.
- Cost control - control costs of human review with configurable filters.
-  Data completeness - ensure extracted data is complete for downstream business applications.
