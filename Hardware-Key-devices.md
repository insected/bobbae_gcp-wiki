### Titan Security Keys

[Titan Security Keys](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) are built with a hardware chip that includes firmware engineered by Google to verify the key’s integrity. This helps to ensure that the keys haven’t been physically tampered with.

### Titan Security chip

Titan comprises several components: a secure application processor, a cryptographic co-processor, a hardware random number generator, a sophisticated key hierarchy, embedded [static RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_random-access_memory) (SRAM), embedded flash and a read-only memory block. Titan communicates with the main CPU via the [Serial Peripheral Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface) (SPI) bus, and interposes between the boot firmware flash of the first privileged component, e.g., the [BMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Platform_Management_Interface) or [Platform Controller Hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_Controller_Hub) (PCH), allowing Titan to observe every byte of boot firmware.
