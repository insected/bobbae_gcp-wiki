[Network File System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System) (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol originally developed by Sun Microsystems.

Original NFS was described in [RFC 1094](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1094). It was implemented over [RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_RPC) and [XDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_Data_Representation).

NFSv3 added TCP/IP Support.  NFSv4 added parallel NFS support.

[Network Attached Storage](NAS) products typically support NFS.
