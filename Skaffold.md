[Skaffold]( https://skaffold.dev/  ) handles the workflow for building, pushing and deploying your application.

[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/docs/) is client-side only. With no on-cluster component, there is no overhead or maintenance burden to your cluster.

Skaffold handles the workflow for building, pushing, and deploying your application, and provides building blocks for creating CI/CD pipelines.
