### Group Project

We can consider the validity of our plans by proposing specific [solutions]( https://cloud.google.com/solutions  ) in  [specific areas](https://cloud.google.com/architecture) and gathering feedback from others. We should start planning on the group project right away after the first week.  You may [review possible project ideas](Projects) from various sources.

## Daily Meetings
