### Group Project

If you are working as a group you can do a group project. The project should be conceived, designed, and implemented by the group.  Coming up with good project ideas is part of the project itself.  We can confirm the validity of our ideas by proposing specific [solutions]( https://cloud.google.com/solutions  ) in  [specific areas](https://cloud.google.com/architecture). 

You should start planning on the group project right away. Don't wait  to start the project. 
You may [review possible project ideas](Projects) ideas from various sources. 

## Daily Meetings

The daily group meetings are held using Google meet to discuss any issues, [questions and answers](https://lincs.ed.gov/sites/default/files/12_TEAL_Deeper_Learning_Qs_complete_5_1_0.pdf) related to the learning materials.  The goal is to unblock any issues each day to make a reasonable progress. 

## Worklog

Each participant will keep an online (e.g. Google Drive)  [daily journal](https://friday.app/p/work-journaling) of their learning, issues encountered and records of progress and share with the instructor and the team.

To spend the meeting time efficiently issues and questions can be noted in writing before the daily meeting.  
The instructor will review your work log each week and you may be graded on the completeness, quality and quantity of your worklog.
