A [data lake](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake) is a centralized repository designed to store, process, and secure large amounts of structured, semistructured, and unstructured data. It can store data in its native format and process any variety of it, ignoring size limits.

## Data lake vs data warehouse

[Data Warehouse](Data-Warehouse) is a blend of technologies and components for the strategic use of data. It collects and manages data from varied sources to provide meaningful business insights. It is the electronic storage of a large amount of information designed for query and analysis instead of transaction processing. It is a process of transforming data into information.
