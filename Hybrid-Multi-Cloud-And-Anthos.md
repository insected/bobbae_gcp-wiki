## Anthos vs AWS Outpost vs Azure Stack

The [AWS Outpost](https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/), Anthos and [Azure Stack](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/azure-stack/) have different goals and characteristics. Each has a unique approach to solving
the hybrid multi cloud issues.

### AWS Outpost

AWS Outpost is a fully managed service that offers the same AWS infrastructure, AWS services, APIs, and tools to virtually any datacenter, co-location space, or on-premises facility for a truly consistent hybrid experience. 

AWS compute, storage, database, and other services run locally on Outposts, and you can access the full range of AWS services available in the Region to build, manage, and scale your on-premises applications using familiar AWS services and tools.

Outposts is available as a 42U rack that can scale from 1 rack to 96 racks to create pools of compute and storage capacity.

Build, deploy, and run hybrid and edge computing apps consistently across your IT ecosystem, with flexibility for diverse workloads.

#### Azure Stack Edge

Get rapid insights with an Azure managed appliance using compute and hardware-accelerated machine learning at edge locations for your Internet of Things (IoT) and AI workloads.


#### Azure Stack HCI


Refresh your virtualization host using a hybrid and hyperconverged solution integrated with Azure.
