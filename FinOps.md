[FinOps](  https://www.finops.org/introduction/what-is-finops/ ) is shorthand for “Cloud Financial Operations” or “Cloud Financial Management” or “Cloud Cost Management”. It is the practice of bringing financial accountability to the variable spend model of cloud, enabling distributed teams to make business trade-offs between speed, cost, and quality.

FinOps is a cultural practice. It’s the way for teams to manage their cloud costs, where everyone takes ownership of their cloud usage supported by a central best-practices group. Cross-functional teams in IT, Finance, Product, etc work together to enable faster product delivery, while at the same time gaining more financial control and predictability.
