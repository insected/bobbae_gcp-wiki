[FinOps](  https://www.finops.org/introduction/what-is-finops/ ) is shorthand for Cloud Financial Operations or Cloud Financial Management or Cloud Cost Management. It is the practice of bringing financial accountability to the [variable spend model of cloud]( 
https://a16z.com/2021/05/27/cost-of-cloud-paradox-market-cap-cloud-lifecycle-scale-growth-repatriation-optimization/ ) , enabling distributed teams to make business trade-offs between speed, cost, and quality.

FinOps is a cultural practice. Itâ€™s the way for teams to manage their [cloud costs](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/cloud-budgets-busted-almost-40-overspent-last-year), where everyone takes ownership of their cloud usage supported by a central best-practices group. Cross-functional teams in IT, Finance, Product, etc work together to enable faster product delivery, while at the same time gaining more financial control and predictability.
