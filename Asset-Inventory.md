[Cloud Asset Inventory](  https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs  ) provides inventory services based on a time series database. This database keeps a five-week history of Google Cloud asset metadata. You can query this database and get the snapshot of your inventory at any particular time instant.

- Search asset metadata by using a custom query language
- Export all asset metadata at a certain timestamp or export event change history during a specific timeframe
- Monitor asset changes by subscribing to real-time notifications
- Analyze IAM policy to find out who has access to what
