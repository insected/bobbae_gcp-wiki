As the number of cloud assets grows in an organization it gets challenging to keep track of the entire inventory of the resources. You can go to each project in your organization and make a list of all the resources individually but its a tedious, time consuming and error prone process. Even if you manage to pull the list of all the resources in all the projects in your organization, it would be a nightmare to maintain how the state of these resources changes over time. It would be near impossible to get the state of your resources at any particular time instant. It gets even more daunting to keep a check that all the resources are holding up the security and compliance standard set by your enterprise.

Cloud Asset Inventory provides inventory services based on a time series database. This database keeps a five-week history of Google Cloud asset metadata. You can query this database and get the snapshot of your inventory at any particular time instant.

- Search asset metadata by using a custom query language
- Export all asset metadata at a certain timestamp or export event change history during a specific timeframe
- Monitor asset changes by subscribing to real-time notifications
- Analyze IAM policy to find out who has access to what
