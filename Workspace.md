#### Essentials

G Suite is Google's Collaborative Applications platform, delivered from Google Cloud. In this introductory-level quest, you will get hands-on practice with G Suite’s core applications from a user perspective. Although there are many more applications and tool components to G Suite than are covered here, you will get experience with the primary apps: Gmail, Calendar, Sheets and a handful of others.

#### Integrations

This Quest of hands-on labs demonstrates the power of integrating Google Cloud services and tools with G Suite applications. With integration technologies like the Clasp Command Line environment, you will create and publish web apps and add-ons for G Suite products: Sheets, Docs, Forms, and Slides. In other labs you'll create direct connections to Google Cloud data sources using the BigQuery API, Sheets, and Slides to collect, analyze and present data.
