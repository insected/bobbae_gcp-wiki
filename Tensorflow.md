[Tensorflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPYj3fFJGjk)    is an [awesome](https://github.com/jtoy/awesome-tensorflow)   open source, powerful, portable [machine learning](Machine-Learning) library developed by Google that can work with very large datasets.

[Keras](Keras) is the high-level API of Tensorflow.

[Kubeflow](Kubeflow) is a [MLOps](MLOps) tool that can manage pipelines including [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/learn).

## Tensorflow.js

Tensorflow.js is a library for machine learning in JavaScript.

Develop ML models in JavaScript, and use ML directly in the browser or in Node.js.

### TensorBoard

Visualizing your model with tensorboard.

TensorBoard provides the visualization and tooling needed for machine learning experimentation:

- Tracking and visualizing metrics such as loss and accuracy
- Visualizing the model graph (ops and layers)
- Viewing histograms of weights, biases, or other tensors as they change over time
- Projecting embeddings to a lower dimensional space
- Displaying images, text, and audio data
- Profiling Tensorflow programs

### Tensorflow Graph

Graphs are data structures that contain a set of [tf.Operation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Operation) objects, which represent units of computation; and [tf.Tensor](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Tensor) objects, which represent the units of data that flow between operations. They are defined in a [tf.Graph](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Graph) context. Since these graphs are data structures, they can be saved, run, and restored all without the original Python code.

### Tensorflow Enterprise

Tensorflow Enterprise makes it easier to develop and deploy Tensorflow models on Google Cloud, by providing users with a set of products and services, which provide enterprise-grade support and cloud scale performance. Users can get the benefits of Tensorflow Enterprise by using the Tensorflow Enterprise Distribution on AI Platform Notebooks, AI Platform Deep Learning Containers and AI Platform Deep Learning VM Image.
