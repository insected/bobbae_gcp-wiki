[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/learn)    is an [awesome](https://github.com/jtoy/awesome-tensorflow)   open source, powerful, portable [machine learning](Machine-Learning) library developed by Google that can work with very large datasets.



[Kubeflow](Kubeflow) is a [MLOps](MLOps) tool that can manage pipelines including Tensorflow.

### TensorFlow Graph

Graphs are data structures that contain a set of [tf.Operation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Operation) objects, which represent units of computation; and [tf.Tensor](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Tensor) objects, which represent the units of data that flow between operations. They are defined in a [tf.Graph](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Graph) context. Since these graphs are data structures, they can be saved, run, and restored all without the original Python code.

### TensorFlow Enterprise

TensorFlow Enterprise makes it easier to develop and deploy TensorFlow models on Google Cloud, by providing users with a set of products and services, which provide enterprise-grade support and cloud scale performance. Users can get the benefits of TensorFlow Enterprise by using the TensorFlow Enterprise Distribution on AI Platform Notebooks, AI Platform Deep Learning Containers and AI Platform Deep Learning VM Image.
