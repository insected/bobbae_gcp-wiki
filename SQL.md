[Structured Query Language](   https://wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL ) (SQL) is the standard language for data manipulation in a [database](Databases). In in simple words its used to talk to the data in a DBMS. Following are types of SQL Statements:

- [Data Definition Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language) (DDL) allows you to create objects like Schemas, Tables in the database
- [Data Control Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_control_language) (DCL) allows you to manipulate and manage access rights on database objects
- [Data Manipulation Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_manipulation_language) (DML) is used for searching, inserting, updating, and deleting data, which will be partially covered in this SQL tutorial.

## Relational Database

A [relational database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database
) is a digital database based on the relational model of data, as proposed by E. F. Codd in 1970. A software system used to maintain relational databases is a relational database management system (RDBMS). Many relational database systems have an option of using the SQL  for querying and maintaining the database.
