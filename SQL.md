Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard language for data manipulation in a DBMS. In in simple words its used to talk to the data in a DBMS. Following are types of SQL Statements:

- Data Definition Language (DDL) allows you to create objects like Schemas, Tables in the database
- Data Control Language (DCL) allows you to manipulate and manage access rights on database objects
- Data Manipulation Language (DML) is used for searching, inserting, updating, and deleting data, which will be partially covered in this SQL tutorial.
