## Introduction

Google Cloud Platform includes [software-defined networking](https://developers.google.com/learn/topics/networking), hybrid connectivity, network performance optimization, [network security](Security), [service mesh](Service-Mesh) deployment, [NAT](Cloud-NAT), [load balancing](Load-Balancer), and [routing](Router).



GCP implements [software-defined network](  https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/google-cloud-networking-in-depth-how-andromeda-2-2-enables-high-throughput-vms ) that provides [fast and reliable connections](  https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/google-cloud-networking-in-depth-series-digest ) to users [around the world](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations).

Google Cloud customers enjoy significantly improved intra-zone network latency with the [Andromeda  software-defined network]( https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/andromeda-2-1-reduces-gcps-intra-zone-latency-by-40-percent  ) (SDN) stack that underpins all of Google Cloud.   [Snap](https://research.google/pubs/pub48630/) is a userspace networking system that supports Googleâ€™s rapidly evolving needs with flexible modules that implement a range of network functions, including edge packet switching, virtualization for our cloud platform, traffic shaping policy enforcement, and a high-performance reliable messaging and RDMA-like service. 



Google's own [Jupiter network fabrics](  https://research.google/pubs/pub43837/ )   can deliver more than 1 Petabit/sec of total bisection bandwidth. To put this in perspective, such [capacity](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2015/06/A-Look-Inside-Googles-Data-Center-Networks.html?m=1) would be enough for 100,000 servers to exchange information at 10Gb/s each, enough to read the entire scanned contents of the Library of Congress in less than 1/10th of a second.

From data centers to subsea cables, GCP connects customers in [different regions](https://www.blog.google/products/google-cloud/expanding-our-global-infrastructure-new-regions-and-subsea-cables/) around the world.

### OSI Model

The [Open Systems Interconnection model]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model  ) (OSI model) is a [conceptual model]( https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/osi-model-computer-networking-for-beginners/  ) that characterises and standardises the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. 


Recommendation X.200 describes seven layers, labelled 1 to 7.





### TCP/IP

The [Internet protocol suite]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite  ), commonly known as TCP/IP, is the set of communications protocols used in the Internet and similar computer networks. The current foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).




### Protocol Wars

https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Wars

### CIDR

[Classless Inter-Domain Routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing   ) is a method for allocating IP addresses and for IP routing. The Internet Engineering Task Force introduced CIDR in 1993 to replace the previous classful network addressing architecture on the Internet. Its goal was to slow the growth of routing tables on routers across the Internet, and to help slow the rapid exhaustion of IPv4 addresses.

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-ip-addresses-subnets-and-cidr-notation-for-networking

### Routing

[IP routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_routing   ) deals with routes of Internet Protocol (IP) packets within and across IP networks. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_table

#### Switch vs Router

https://www.guru99.com/router-vs-switch-difference.html

### Routing Protocols

A [routing protocol](  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_protocol ) specifies how routers communicate with each other to distribute information that enables them to select routes between nodes on a computer network. 



### Subnetwork

A [subnetwork or subnet]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork  ) is a logical subdivision of an IP network. The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting.

## Network Security

Network [Security](Security) consists of the policies, processes, and practices adopted to prevent, detect and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of a computer network and network-accessible resources.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_security

## LAN

A [local area network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network
) (LAN) is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus, or office building. By contrast, a wide area network (WAN) not only covers a larger geographic distance but also generally involves leased telecommunication circuits.

[Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet) and [Wi-Fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi) are the two most common technologies in use for local area networks. Other LAN technologies include [ARCNET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARCNET), [Token Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Ring), [FDDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_Distributed_Data_Interface) and [AppleTalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleTalk).


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network


## WAN

A [wide area network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_network
) (WAN) is a telecommunications network that extends over a large geographic area for the primary purpose of computer networking. Wide area networks are often established with leased telecommunication circuits.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_network

## NAT

[Network address translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation
) (NAT) is a method of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device. 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation


## Firewall

A [firewall](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-firewalls
) is a network security system that monitors and controls the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. 

A firewall rule can contain either IPv4 or IPv6 ranges, but not both.

https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-firewalls

### Netfilter

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netfilter


## Underlay network

The Underlay network is closer to the physical layer. It includes switches, routers, VLANs, and so on. It is the basis on which overlay networks are built.

https://networkingnerd.net/tag/underlay-network/

## Overlay network

Overlay network refers to the virtual network layer. It is designed to be highly scalable than the underlying network. For example, while VLANs in the underlying network support only 4096 identifiers, VxLAN can reach up to 16 million ones.


https://book.systemsapproach.org/applications/overlays.html


## Kubernetes CNI

A [CNI](Kubernetes-Networking#cni) is a link between the container runtime (like Docker or rkt) and the network plugin. A CNI is a set of rules and Go libraries that aid in container/network-plugin integration.
