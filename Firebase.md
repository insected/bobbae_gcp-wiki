[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is an app dev platform built on the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/products) providing services and cross-platform SDKs.

## GCP & Firebase 

Firebase projects are GCP Projects.

### Firebase Realtime Database

Store and sync data with our NoSQL cloud database. Data is synced across all clients in real time, and remains available when your app goes offline. The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted database. Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in realtime to every connected client. 

[https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/)


### Cloud Firestore or Realtime Database

Firebase offers two cloud-based, client-accessible database solutions that support real time data syncing.

#### Cloud Firestore

Cloud [Firestore](Firestore) is Firebase's newest database for mobile app development. It builds on the successes of the Realtime Database with a new, more intuitive data model. Cloud Firestore also features richer, faster queries and scales further than the Realtime Database.

#### Realtime Database

Firebase Realtime Database is Firebase's original database. It's an efficient, low-latency solution for mobile apps that require synced states across clients in real time.

### Firebase Authentication

Most apps need to know the identity of a user. Knowing a user's identity allows an app to securely save user data in the cloud and provide the same personalized experience across all of the user's devices. Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app. It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more. Firebase Authentication integrates tightly with other Firebase services, and it leverages industry standards like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, so it can be easily integrated with your custom backend.

### Cloud Functions for Firebase

Cloud Functions for Firebase is a [serverless](serverless) framework that lets you automatically run backend code in response to events triggered by Firebase features and HTTPS requests. Your JavaScript or TypeScript code is stored in Google's cloud and runs in a managed environment.

### Cloud Storage for Firebase

The Firebase SDKs for [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) add Google security to file uploads and downloads for your Firebase apps. You can use the SDKs to store images, audio, video, or other user-generated content. On the server, you can use [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage), to access the same files.

### Firebase Test Lab

Firebase Test Lab is a cloud-based app-testing infrastructure that allows testing Android or iOS apps across a wide variety of devices and device configurations, and see the results—including logs, videos, and screenshots—in the Firebase console.

### Firebase Crashlytics

[Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics
) is a lightweight, realtime crash reporter that helps you track, prioritize, and fix stability issues that erode your app quality.
