[TensorFlow Extended](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx) is an open source project for building ML pipelines that orchestrate end-to-end ML workflows.

A TFX pipeline is a sequence of components that implement an ML pipeline which is specifically designed for scalable, high-performance machine learning tasks. Components are built using TFX libraries which can also be used individually.
