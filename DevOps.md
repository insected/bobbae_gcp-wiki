## Introduction

[DevOps](https://cloud.google.com/devops/) is an organizational and cultural movement that aims to increase software delivery velocity, improve service reliability, and build shared ownership among software stakeholders. 

## DevSecOps

DevOps isnâ€™t just about development and operations teams. If you want to take full advantage of the agility and responsiveness of a DevOps approach, [IT security](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/security) must also play an integrated role in the full life cycle of your apps.

## Hybrid Cloud DevOps

Running in a hybrid environment means that some of your processing happens on Google Cloud and other processing remains on-premises. Anthos helps you manage both an on-premises Kubernetes cluster and a cluster running on Google Cloud.

Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is the Kubernetes management and orchestration system for containers and Kubernetes clusters that run within Google's public cloud services.

Anthos clusters on VMware runs privately on your own servers with regulated access to help meet your requirements for on-premises data processing.

## GitOps 

GitOps is a way to do application delivery. It works by using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) as a single source of truth for [declarative infrastructure and applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code), together with tools ensuring the _actual state_ of infrastructure and applications converges towards the _desired state_ declared in Git. With Git at the center of your delivery pipelines, developers can make pull requests to accelerate and simplify application deployments and operations tasks to your infrastructure or container-orchestration system (e.g. [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)).

The term GitOps was [first coined by Weaveworks](https://www.weave.works/blog/gitops-operations-by-pull-request), and its key concept is using a Git repository to store the environment state that you want.

### Cloud Build Tutorial

This tutorial explains how to manage infrastructure as code with [Terraform](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform) and [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build) using the popular [GitOps](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-gitops-and-why-it-might-be-the-next-big-thing-for-devops/) methodology. 

Use [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build), a Google Cloud continuous integration service, to automatically apply Terraform manifests to your environment.

## Tekton

Tekton is a cloud native continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) solution. It allows developers to build, test, and deploy across cloud providers and on-premise systems. Tekton is a powerful yet flexible Kubernetes-native open-source framework for creating continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) systems. It lets you build, test, and deploy across multiple cloud providers or on-premises systems by abstracting away the underlying implementation details.
