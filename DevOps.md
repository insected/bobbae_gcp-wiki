[DevOps](https://cloud.google.com/devops/) is an organizational and cultural movement that aims to increase software delivery velocity, improve service reliability, and build shared ownership among software stakeholders. 

The goal of [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) is to build better, faster and more responsive software by bringing Development and Operations teams together. [DevOps](https://devops-research.com/) is not a methodology or [a suite of tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps_toolchain) but a cultural shift to remove the barriers between Dev and Ops in order to meet the need for shorter and more frequent software deliveries.

The [DevOps](   https://cloud.google.com/docs/tutorials?q=big%20data   ) cultural shift depends on continuously optimizing workflow, architecture, and infrastructure in order to deliver high-quality applications.

## Cloud Build

[Cloud Build](Cloud-Build) is a service that executes your builds on Google Cloud Platform's infrastructure.

## DevSecOps

[DevSecOps](DevSecOps) is a culture shift in the software industry that aims to bake security into the rapid-release cycles that are typical of modern application development and deployment.


## DevOps Research and Assessment

[Google’s DORA team](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html) conducted a six-year research program which validated a number of technical, process, measurement, and cultural capabilities that drive higher software delivery and organizational performance. Explore DORA’s research program and discover these capabilities, how to implement them, and how to overcome common obstacles.


## Hybrid Cloud DevOps

Running in a hybrid environment means that some of your processing happens on Google Cloud and other processing remains on-premises. [Anthos](Anthos) helps you manage both an on-premises [Kubernetes](Kubernetes) cluster and a cluster running on Google Cloud.
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is the Kubernetes management and orchestration system for containers and Kubernetes clusters that run within Google's public cloud services.
Anthos clusters on [VMware](VMWare) runs privately on your own servers with regulated access to help meet your requirements for on-premises data processing.

## GitOps 

[GitOps](GitOps) is a way of implementing Continuous Deployment for cloud native applications. 





## CICD Tools

Many [CICD](CICD) tools available: Jenkins X, Tekton, Docker, Helm, Skaffold, ChartMuseum, Knative, Prow, etc.


## DataOps vs MLOps

[DataOps](DataOps) takes the practices and values of DevOps and extends it to data analytics workflows and goals. It applies the focus on collaboration and shared responsibility and shifts it to the engineers and admins that collect, store, analyze, secure, and deliver data.

* [DataOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataOps) is an automated, process-oriented methodology, used by analytic and data teams, to improve the quality and reduce the cycle time of data analytics.

* [MLOps](MLOps) is a practice for collaboration and communication between data scientists and operations professionals to help manage the production of ML lifecycle. MLOps looks to increase automation and [improve the quality of production ML](https://towardsdatascience.com/devsecops-vs-dataops-vs-mlops-93b49f0282b8)  while also focusing on business and regulatory requirements.


## Ops terminology

## SRE

[SRE](SRE) is what you get when you treat operations as if it's a software problem.
