[DevSecOps](https://snyk.io/devsecops/) is a culture shift in the software industry that aims to bake security into the rapid-release cycles that are typical of modern application development and deployment.

[DevSecOps](https://resources.github.com/whitepapers/Architects-guide-to-DevOps/) isnâ€™t just about development and operations teams. If you want to take full [advantage of the agility](https://tech.gsa.gov/guides/understanding_differences_agile_devsecops/) and responsiveness of a [DevOps](DevOps) approach, [IT security](Security) and [privacy](Privacy) must also [play an integrated role](https://techbeacon.com/security/devsecops-realities-app-dev-teams-must-accept) in the [full life cycle of your apps](https://github.blog/2020-08-13-secure-at-every-step-a-guide-to-devsecops-shifting-left-and-gitops/).


[DevSecOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps#DevSecOps,_Shifting_Security_Left) reflect a culture shift in the software industry that aims to bake security into the rapid-release cycles that are typical of modern application development and deployment, also known as the [DevOps](DevOps) movement. Embracing this [shift-left mentality](https://smartbear.com/learn/automated-testing/shifting-left-in-testing/) requires organizations to bridge the gap that usually exists between development and security teams to the point where many of the security processes are automated and handled by the development team itself.

### Security and Privacy

The [security](Security) and [privacy](Privacy) issues from the [DevSecOps point of view](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3245748/what-is-devsecops-developing-more-secure-applications.html) require [a cultural shift](https://www.coalfire.com/the-coalfire-blog/july-2020/successful-devsecops-begins-with-a-cultural-shift).

### Binary Authorization

[Binary Authorization](https://cloud.google.com/binary-authorization) is a deploy-time security control that ensures only trusted container images are deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or Cloud Run. With Binary Authorization, you can require images to be signed by trusted authorities during the development process and then enforce signature validation when deploying. By enforcing validation, you can gain tighter control over your container environment by ensuring only verified images are integrated into the build-and-release process.
