Terraform is a tool from Hashicorp for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.


# Infrastructure as Code

[Infrastructure as Code](Infrastructure-as-Code)  is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

Terraform's infrastructure-as-code (IAC) approach supports [DevOps](https://cloud.google.com/devops) best practices for change management, letting you manage Terraform configuration files in source control to maintain an ideal provisioning state for testing and production environments.

Defining and managing your development, test, staging, and production environments using infra-as-code tools such as [Deployment Manager](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager) or [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is a common practice. Ensuring that any changes you make to your environment config definitions are “safe” remains challenging, though.

## Terraform Quest

In this Quest, the experienced user of Google Cloud will learn how to describe and launch cloud resources with Terraform, an open source tool that codifies APIs into declarative configuration files that can be shared amongst team members, treated as code, edited, reviewed, and versioned. In these nine hands-on labs, you will work with example templates and understand how to launch a range of configurations, from simple servers, through full load-balanced applications.
