## API Gateway
[API Gateway](https://cloud.google.com/api-gateway) is  a fully-managed gateway for serverless workloads.
API Gateway enables you to provide secure access to your backend services through a well-defined REST API that is consistent across all of your services, regardless of the service implementation. Clients consume your REST APIS to implement standalone apps for a mobile device or tablet, through apps running in a browser, or through any other type of app that can make a request to an HTTP endpoint.


## API Management, Apigee

[Apigee](https://cloud.google.com/apigee) is a Full-LifeCycle API Management tool.

### Apigee Developer Portal

Using the Drupal portal development tools, you can build a fully customizable developer portal. Drupal provides a rich set of functionality and all the CMS capabilities of Drupal with additional Apigee-developed Drupal modules. However, implementing a Drupal-based portal requires more time and effort.

### Apigee API Analytics

 Edge API Analytics collects and calculates a wealth of information that flows through API proxies. You can visualize this data with graphs and charts in the Edge UI, or you can download the raw data for offline analysis using the Edge management APIs.

### Apigee API Monetization

As an API provider, you need an easy-to-use and flexible way to monetize your APIs so that you can generate revenue for the use of your APIs. Using monetization in Apigee Edge, you can create a variety of monetization plans that charge developers (or pay them through revenue sharing) for the use of your APIs.

### Apigee Hybrid

Apigee hybrid is a platform for developing and managing API proxies that features a hybrid deployment model. The hybrid model includes a management plane hosted by Apigee in the Cloud and a runtime plane that you install and manage on one of the [supported Kubernetes platforms](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/hybrid/v1.3/install-before-begin#supported-platforms).
