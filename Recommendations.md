[Recommendations AI]( https://cloud.google.com/retail/recommendations-ai/docs  ) enables you to build an end to end personalized recommendation system based on state-of-the-art deep learning ML models, without a need for expertise in ML or recommendation systems. 

## Overview


You can use Recommendations AI to get personalized recommendations for your website whether or not you are using Google marketing tools. However, if you are using [Google Tag Manager](  https://tagmanager.google.com/   ) or [Google Merchant Center](https://www.google.com/retail/solutions/merchant-center/), some steps to implement Recommendations AI are simplified.

## Catalogs


The catalog data you import into Recommendations AI has a direct effect on the quality of the resulting model, and therefore on the quality of the predictions Recommendations AI provides. In general, the more accurate and specific catalog information you can provide, the higher quality your model.

Your catalog should be kept up to date. You can upload catalog changes as often as needed; ideally, every day for catalogs with a high rate of change. You can upload (patch) existing product items; only the changed fields will be updated. There is no charge for uploading catalog information.

## Recommendation Model Types


When you sign up to use Recommendations AI, you work with Recommendations AI Support to determine the best recommendation models and customizations to use for your site. The models and customizations you use depend on your business needs, and where you plan to display the resulting recommendations.

When you request recommendations from Recommendations AI, you provide the placement value, which determines which model is used to return your recommendations.

## A/B Testing

An A/B experiment is a randomized experiment with two groups: an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group receives some different treatment (in this case, predictions from Recommendations AI); the control group does not.

When you run an A/B experiment with Recommendations AI, you include the information about which group a user was in when you record user events. Recommendations AI uses that information to refine the model and provide metrics.

Both versions of your application must be the same, except that users in the experimental group see recommendations generated by Recommendations AI and the control group does not. You log user events for both groups.

### Alerts

Keeping your catalog up to date and recording user events successfully is important for getting high-quality recommendations. Even if your initial imports and event recording are successful, monitoring error rates is still needed in case of unexpected environmental issues, such as network connectivity failures.

You should set up Cloud Monitoring alerts so you can take action promptly in case any issues arise with user event recording and predictions. You can also monitor recent data integration error rates in the Google Cloud Console at any time.
