# Introduction

Whenever you perform classification, the first step is to understand the problem and identify potential features and labels. Features are those characteristics or attributes which affect the results of the label. For example, in the case of a loan distribution, bank manager's identify the customer's occupation, income, age, location, previous loan history, transaction history, and credit score. These characteristics are known as features which help the model classify customers.

# Phases

The classification has two phases, a learning phase, and the evaluation phase. In the learning phase, the classifier trains its model on a given dataset and in the evaluation phase, it tests the classifier performance. Performance is evaluated on the basis of various parameters such as accuracy, error, precision, and recall.
