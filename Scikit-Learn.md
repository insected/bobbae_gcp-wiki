# Phases

The classification has two phases, a learning phase, and the evaluation phase. In the learning phase, the classifier trains its model on a given dataset and in the evaluation phase, it tests the classifier performance. Performance is evaluated on the basis of various parameters such as accuracy, error, precision, and recall.
