[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling the queries with your existing data. Developers are increasingly adopting GraphQL for its flexibility and ease of use. It provides a single endpoint for all data exchange, prevents over- or under-fetching of data, and lets developers make one API call that seamlessly aggregates data from multiple apps and services.
