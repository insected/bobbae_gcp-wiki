A [hypervisor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor) (or virtual machine monitor, VMM, virtualizer) is a kind of emulator; it is computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines. A computer on which a hypervisor runs one or more [virtual machines](VM) is called a host machine, and each virtual machine is called a guest machine.
