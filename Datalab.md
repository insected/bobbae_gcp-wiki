## Introduction

[Cloud Datalab](https://cloud.google.com/datalab/docs)    can be used to easily explore, visualize, analyze, and transform data using familiar languages, such as Python and SQL, interactively. Datalab comes with pre-installed [Jupyter](Jupyter) samples and tutorial notebooks.  

Datalab can be used to  show you how to access, analyze, monitor and visualize data.  You can use notebooks with Python, TensorFlow ML, Google Analytics, BigQuery and Google Charts APIs.

## Lifecycle 

[Cloud Datalab](https://cloud.google.com/datalab/docs) runs inside of a Google Compute Engine VM with an attached persistent disk that is used to store notebooks. 

Cloud Datalab VMs are connected to a special network in a project called datalab-network. 

The default configuration of this network limits incoming connections to SSH connections.
