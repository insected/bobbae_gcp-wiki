The IPython Notebook is now known as the Jupyter Notebook.

Jupyter is an interactive computational environment, in which you can combine code execution, rich text, mathematics, plots and rich media.

The name “Jupyter” is a strong reference to Galileo, who detailed his discovery of the Moons of Jupiter in his astronomical notebooks. 

The name “Jupyter” is also a play on the languages Julia, Python, and R, which are pillars of the modern scientific world. 

JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data.

# JupyterHub

With JupyterHub you can create a multi-user Hub which spawns, manages, and proxies multiple instances of the single-user Jupyter notebook server.
JupyterHub allows users to interact with a computing environment through a webpage. As most devices have access to a web browser, JupyterHub makes it is easy to provide and standardize the computing environment for a group of people (e.g., for a class of students or an analytics team).
