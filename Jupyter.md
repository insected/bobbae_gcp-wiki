The IPython Notebook is now known as the Jupyter Notebook.

Jupyter is an interactive computational environment, in which you can combine code execution, rich text, mathematics, plots and rich media.

The name “Jupyter” is a strong reference to Galileo, who detailed his discovery of the Moons of Jupiter in his astronomical notebooks. 

Jupyter is also a play on the languages Julia, Python, and R, which are pillars of the modern scientific world. 

JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data.
