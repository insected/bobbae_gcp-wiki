# MLOps

Machine learning (ML) workflows include steps to prepare and analyze data, train and evaluate models, deploy trained models to production, track ML artifacts and understand their dependencies, etc. Managing these steps in an ad-hoc manner can be difficult and time-consuming.

MLOps is the practice of applying DevOps practices to help automate, manage, and audit ML workflows. AI Platform Pipelines helps you implement MLOps by providing a platform where you can orchestrate the steps in your workflow as a pipeline. ML pipelines are portable and reproducible definitions of ML workflows.

## TFX

TFX is an open source project that you can use to define your ML workflow as a pipeline. Currently, TFX components can only train TensorFlow based models. TFX provides components that you can use to ingest and transform data, train and evaluate a model, deploy a trained model for inference, etc. By using the TFX SDK, you can compose a pipeline for your ML process from TFX components.
