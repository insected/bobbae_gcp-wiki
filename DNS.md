The [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) (DNS) is a system for associating various types of information – such as IP addresses – with easy-to-remember names. By default most Kubernetes clusters automatically configure an internal DNS service to provide a lightweight mechanism for service discovery. Built-in service discovery makes it easier for applications to find and communicate with each other on Kubernetes clusters, even when pods and services are being created, deleted, and shifted between nodes.

## Google Cloud DNS


[Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns) allows you to publish your domain names by using Google's infrastructure for production-quality, high-volume [DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/)    services. Google's global network of anycast name servers provides reliable, low-latency, authoritative name lookups for your domains from anywhere in the world.


## Kubernetes DNS Server

Kubernetes creates [DNS records for services and pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/). You can contact services with consistent DNS names instead of IP addresses.

Kubernetes DNS schedules a DNS Pod and Service on the cluster, and configures the kubelets to tell individual containers to use the DNS Service's IP to resolve DNS names.

Every Service defined in the cluster (including the DNS server itself) is assigned a DNS name. By default, a client Pod's DNS search list includes the Pod's own namespace and the cluster's default domain.

## Service Discovery and DNS

In Kubernetes, [service discovery](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/service-discovery) is implemented with autogenerated service names that map to the service's IP address. Service names follow a standard specification: my-svc.my-namespace.svc.my-zone. Pods can also access external services, like example.com, through their names. See DNS for Services and Pods for more information on the behaviour of DNS in Kubernetes.

The kube-dns Pods are in the kube-system namespace. The kube-dns deployment is accessed through a corresponding Service that groups the kube-dns Pods and gives them a single IP address. By default, all Pods in a cluster use this service to resolve DNS queries.

As of Kubernetes v1.12, [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io/) is the recommended DNS Server, replacing kube-dns. If your cluster originally used kube-dns, you may still have kube-dns deployed rather than CoreDNS.


[kubelet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet) sets each new pod’s `/etc/resolv.conf` nameserver option to the cluster IP of the kube-dns service, with appropriate search options to allow for shorter hostnames to be used:

```
nameserver 10.32.0.10
search namespace.svc.cluster.local svc.cluster.local cluster.local
options ndots:5
```

Applications running in containers can then resolve hostnames such as `example-service.namespace` into the correct cluster IP addresses.

### Example Kubernetes DNS records


The full DNS A record of a Kubernetes service will look like the following example:

```
service.namespace.svc.cluster.local
```

A pod would have a record in this format, reflecting the actual IP address of the pod:

```
10.32.0.125.namespace.pod.cluster.local
```


Additionally, SRV records are created for a Kubernetes service’s named ports:

```
_port-name._protocol.service.namespace.svc.cluster.local
```


The result of all this is a built-in, DNS-based service discovery mechanism, where your application or microservice can target a simple and consistent hostname to access other services or pods on the cluster.


### Search Domains and Resolving Shorter Hostnames

Because of the search domain suffixes listed in the `resolv.conf` file, you often won’t need to use the full hostname to contact another service. If you’re addressing a service in the same namespace, you can use just the service name to contact it:

```
other-service
```

If the service is in a different namespace, add it to the query:

```
other-service.other-namespace
```

If you’re targeting a pod, you’ll need to use at least the following:

```
pod-ip.other-namespace.pod
```


As we saw in the default `resolv.conf` file, only `.svc` suffixes are automatically completed, so make sure you specify everything up to .pod.
