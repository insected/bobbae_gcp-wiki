# Introduction

[Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns) allows you to publish your domain names by using Google's infrastructure for production-quality, high-volume DNS services. Google's global network of anycast name servers provides reliable, low-latency, authoritative name lookups for your domains from anywhere in the world.

# [Kubernetes DNS Server](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/)

Kubernetes creates DNS records for services and pods. You can contact services with consistent DNS names instead of IP addresses.

Kubernetes DNS schedules a DNS Pod and Service on the cluster, and configures the kubelets to tell individual containers to use the DNS Service's IP to resolve DNS names.

Every Service defined in the cluster (including the DNS server itself) is assigned a DNS name. By default, a client Pod's DNS search list includes the Pod's own namespace and the cluster's default domain.

# Service Discovery and DNS

In Kubernetes, [service discovery](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/service-discovery) is implemented with autogenerated service names that map to the service's IP address. Service names follow a standard specification: my-svc.my-namespace.svc.my-zone. Pods can also access external services, like example.com, through their names. See DNS for Services and Pods for more information on the behaviour of DNS in Kubernetes.

The kube-dns Pods are in the kube-system namespace. The kube-dns deployment is accessed through a corresponding Service that groups the kube-dns Pods and gives them a single IP address. By default, all Pods in a cluster use this service to resolve DNS queries.

As of Kubernetes v1.12, [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io/) is the recommended DNS Server, replacing kube-dns. If your cluster originally used kube-dns, you may still have kube-dns deployed rather than CoreDNS.
