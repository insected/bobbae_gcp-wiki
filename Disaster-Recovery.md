[Disaster Recovery](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/backup-dr) is a subset of [business continuity planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_continuity_planning). DR planning begins with a business impact analysis that defines two key metrics:

    - A [recovery time objective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_recovery#Recovery_Time_Objective) (RTO), as part of a larger service level agreement (SLA).
    - A [recovery point objective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_recovery#Recovery_Point_Objective) (RPO)
