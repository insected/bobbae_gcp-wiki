## AI Platform with AutoML

AI Platform (Unified) brings AutoML and AI Platform (Classic) together into a unified API, client library, and user interface. With AI Platform (Unified), both AutoML training and custom training are available options. Whichever option you choose for training, you can save models, deploy models and request predictions with AI Platform (Unified)

AutoML Vision enables you to train machine learning models to classify your images according to your own defined labels.

- Train models from labeled images and evaluate their performance.
- Leverage a human labeling service for datasets with unlabeled images.
- Register trained models for serving through the AutoML API.

AutoML Vision Edge now allows you to export your custom trained models.

- AutoML Vision Edge allows you to train and deploy low-latency, high accuracy models optimized for edge devices.
- With Tensorflow Lite, Core ML, and container export formats, AutoML Vision Edge supports a variety of devices.
- Hardware architectures supported: Edge TPUs, ARM and NVIDIA.
- To build an application on iOS or Android devices you can use AutoML Vision Edge in ML Kit. This solution is available via Firebase and offers an end-to-end development flow for creating and deploying custom models to mobile devices using ML Kit client libraries.
