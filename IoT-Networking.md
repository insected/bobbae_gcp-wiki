The Internet of things ([IoT](IoT)) describes the network of physical objects.

## 802.15.4

[IEEE 802.15.4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4
) is a technical standard that defines the operation of low-rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs). It specifies the physical layer and media access control for LR-WPANs, and is maintained by the [IEEE 802.15](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-ieee-802-15-4-technology/) working group, which defined the standard in 2003.

### ZigBee 

[ZigBee](https://zigbeealliance.org/solution/zigbee/
) is a 2.4 GHz mesh local area network (LAN) protocol. It was originally designed for building automation and control—so things like wireless thermostats and lighting systems often use ZigBee.




### LoRaWAN 

[LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/
) is a media access control (MAC) layer protocol designed for large-scale public networks with a single operator. It is built using Semtech’s LoRa modulation as the underlying PHY, but it is important to note that LoRa and LoRaWAN are two seperate things that are often (mistakenly) conflated. 



## Telecom

### GPRS 

[General Packet Radio Service](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-general-packet-radio-service-gprs
) (GPRS) is a packet oriented mobile data standard on the 2G and 3G cellular communication network's global system for mobile communications (GSM). GPRS was established by European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in response to the earlier CDPD and i-mode packet-switched cellular technologies. It is now maintained by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).



### GSM

The [Global System for Mobile Communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM) (GSM) is a standard developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to describe the protocols for second-generation (2G) digital cellular networks used by mobile devices such as mobile phones and tablets. It was first deployed in Finland in December 1991.


### LTE 

The Long-Term Evolution [LTE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE) is a standard for wireless broadband for mobile access based on GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA.


### LTE-M1

[LTE-M1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE-M) is the first cellular wireless protocol that was build from the ground up for IoT devices. 


### NB-IoT

[NB-IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrowband_IoT), or Narrowband IoT, is another way to tackle [Cellular M2M](https://www.simfony.com/what-is-m2m-cellular-connectivity/) for low power devices. It is based on a [DSSS modulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-sequence_spread_spectrum) similar to the old [Neul version of Weightless-W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weightless_(wireless_communications)). Huawei, Ericsson, and Qualcomm are active proponents of this protocol and are involved in putting it together.



### 3G & 4G

[3G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G) was the first “high speed” cellular network, and is a name that refers to a number of technologies that meet [IMT-2000 standards](https://networkencyclopedia.com/imt-2000/). [4G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4G) is the generation of cellular standards that followed 3G, and is what most people use today for mobile cellular data. You can use 3G and 4G for IoT devices, but the application needs a constant power source or must be able to be recharged regularly.

### 5G


[5G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G
) is the fifth generation technology standard for broadband cellular networks, which cellular phone companies began deploying worldwide in 2019, and is the planned successor to the 4G networks which provide connectivity to most current cellphones. 5G networks are predicted to have more than 1.7 billion subscribers worldwide by 2025, according to the GSM Association.

## IoT Application and Message protocols

### MQTT 

An MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight IoT data protocol. It features a publisher-subscriber messaging model and allows for simple data flow between different devices.

MQTT’s main selling point is its architecture. Its genetic make-up is basic and lightweight and, therefore, it’s able to provide low power consumption for devices. It also works on top of a TCP/IP protocol.

IoT data protocols were designed to tackle unreliable communication networks. This became a need in the IoT world due to the increasing number of small, cheap, and lower-power objects that have appeared in the network over the past few years.

### CoAP

A [CoAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_Application_Protocol
) (Constrained Application Protocol) is an application layer protocol. It’s designed to address the needs of HTTP-based IoT systems. 




### AMQP 

An [Advanced Message Queuing Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol) (AMQP) is an open standard application layer protocol used for transactional messages between servers.


AMQP was originated at JPMorgan Chase in London and [RabbitMQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RabbitMQ) was developed in [Erlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)).


### DDS 


[DDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Distribution_Service) (Data Distribution Service) is another scalable IoT protocol that works to a publisher-subscriber model.


## Industrial Networking

### Modbus

[Modbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus
) is an industrial serial communication protocol based on [Modicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller#Modicon) plus [Fieldbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fieldbus).

### PROFIBUS


[PROFIBUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profibus
) (a portmanteau for Process Field Bus) is a standard for Fieldbus communication in automation technology and was first promoted in 1989 by BMBF (German department of education and research) and then used by Siemens, published as part of IEC 61158. 



### PROFINET

[PROFINET](https://www.profibus.com/technology/profinet/) is a standard for Industrial Ethernet. Profibus is openly 



### CAN Bus

A [Controller Area Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus
) (CAN bus) is a vehicle bus standard and a message-based protocol designed to allow [microcontrollers](https://www.elprocus.com/different-microcontrollers-used-in-automobiles/) and devices to communicate with each other's applications without a host computer. 


### SCADA

Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) is a control system architecture used in the Machine industry.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA

## Mesh

### Bluetooth Mesh

[Bluetooth mesh networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_mesh_networking) uses [Bluetooth Low Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy) to allow for many-to-many communication over [Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth) radio.

### Wireless mesh

[Wireless mesh network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_mesh_network) organizes radio nodes in a mesh topology. Many use a [FDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-division_multiplexing) method while some use [TDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-division_multiplexing).
