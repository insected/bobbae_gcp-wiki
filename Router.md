Cloud Router enables you to dynamically exchange routes between your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and on-premises networks by using [Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol). 

For example, if you use a Cloud VPN tunnel to connect your networks, you can use Cloud Router to establish a BGP session with your on-premises router over your Cloud VPN tunnel. Cloud Router automatically learns new subnets in your VPC network and announces them to your on-premises network.

## BGP



Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a standardized exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information among autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet. BGP is classified as a path-vector routing protocol, and it makes routing decisions based on paths, network policies, or rule-sets configured by a network administrator.


[Cloud Router uses Border Gateway Protocol](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/router/how-to/configuring-bgp) (BGP) to exchange routes between your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network and your on-premises network. 

On Cloud Router, you configure an interface and a [BGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol) peer for your on-premises router. The interface and BGP peer configuration together form a BGP session.
