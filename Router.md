# Introduction to Cloud Router

Cloud Router enables you to dynamically exchange routes between your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and on-premises networks by using [Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol). For example, if you use a Cloud VPN tunnel to connect your networks, you can use Cloud Router to establish a BGP session with your on-premises router over your Cloud VPN tunnel. Cloud Router automatically learns new subnets in your VPC network and announces them to your on-premises network.

# BGP

[Cloud Router uses Border Gateway Protocol ](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/router/how-to/configuring-bgp)(BGP) to exchange routes between your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network and your on-premises network. On Cloud Router, you configure an interface and a BGP peer for your on-premises router. The interface and BGP peer configuration together form a BGP session.
