[WebAssembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly) (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

## WASI

WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) is a simple interface (ABI and API) designed by Mozilla intended to be portable to any platform. It provides POSIX-like features like file I/O constrained by capability-based security. There are also a few other proposed ABI/APIs.
