[Data Engineering](https://quanthub.com/what-is-data-engineering/) is a set of operations aimed at creating interfaces and mechanisms for the flow and access of information.  Data engineers set up and operate the organization’s [data infrastructure]( https://towardsdatascience.com/scalable-efficient-big-data-analytics-machine-learning-pipeline-architecture-on-cloud-4d59efc092b5 ) preparing it for further analysis by [data analysts and scientists](Data-Science).

There are [awesome](https://github.com/igorbarinov/awesome-data-engineering) and [freely available books](https://github.com/andkret/Cookbook), [roadmaps](https://github.com/datastacktv/data-engineer-roadmap) and [courses](https://github.com/chandra1sekar/data-engineering).



Here is a basic [overview of GCP data storage features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc2940Zwvyk).


## Data Analytics 

What is [the difference]( https://blog.panoply.io/what-is-the-difference-between-a-data-engineer-and-a-data-scientist ) between  [Data Science](Data-Science) vs Data  Engineering?

## Database options

One of Google Cloud Platform's competitive advantages is the [strong ecosystem of managed databases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aHBkfBRFEU).  However, the wealth of options can be confusing to navigate as you look for the right technologies to grow your product.  

Because we have so many available, [choosing the right database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YnLuEdGzU8) for your workloads can be confusing.
We can compare different [GCP Database services](https://cloud.google.com/products/databases) and make the best decision for each use case.

Besides the GCP provided database services, there are also a lot of [other databases](Databases) to choose from that may be available elsewhere.

## Cloud SQL

[Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql) is a fully-managed database service that helps you set up, maintain, manage, and administer your relational databases on Google Cloud Platform.

You can use [Cloud SQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvR2KX8GVtU) with [MySQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql), [PostgreSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres), or [SQL Server](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/sqlserver). 


## SQL

[SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_intro.asp) is commonly pronounced “sequel.” Its most popular variants are MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite - a version of [SQL](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/index.htm) which is commonly used for prototyping. It introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command, using SQL Queries.
