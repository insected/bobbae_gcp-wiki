Cloud computing delivers faster, more agile responses to changing business demands than previous ways used to deliver IT services. Along with these and other numerous benefits, the cloud also introduces a significant risk: the loss of control. This can lead to [cost overruns](finops), inefficient use of cloud resources, security breaches, data leaks and failure to meet [compliance](compliance) obligations.


[Cloud governance](  https://www.cloudhealthtech.com/blog/what-is-cloud-governance ) is a set of practices that help ensure users operate in the cloud in ways that they want, that the operations are efficient, and that the user can monitor and correct operations as needed. A cloud governance framework is not a new set of concepts or practices, but simply the application of existing governance practices to cloud operations.

## Cloud Custodian


[Cloud Custodian]( https://github.com/cloud-custodian/cloud-custodian)  is a rules engine for managing public cloud accounts and resources. It allows users to define policies to enable a well managed cloud infrastructure, that's both secure and cost optimized. It consolidates many of the adhoc scripts organizations have into a lightweight and flexible tool, with unified metrics and reporting.
