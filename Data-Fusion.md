[Data Fusion]( https://cloud.google.com/data-fusion  ) is a fully managed, cloud-native, scalable data integration platform. It is a
GUI based data integration service for building and managing data pipelines

Data Fusion is built using open source project [CDAP](https://github.com/cdapio/cdap), and this open core ensures data pipeline portability for users. CDAP’s broad integration with on-premises and public cloud platforms gives Cloud Data Fusion users the ability to break down silos and deliver insights that were previously inaccessible.

CDAP is an integrated, open source application development platform for the Hadoop ecosystem that provides developers with data and application abstractions to simplify and accelerate application development, address a broader range of real-time and batch use cases, and deploy applications into production while satisfying enterprise requirements.

Under the hood, Data Fusion executes pipelines on a Dataproc cluster. Data Fusion automatically converts GUI based pipelines into Dataproc jobs for execution whenever a pipeline is executed. It supports two execution engine options: MapReduce and Apache Spark.

## Modern, more secure data lakes on Google Cloud

Cloud Data Fusion helps users build scalable, distributed data lakes on Google Cloud by integrating data from siloed on-premises platforms. Customers can leverage the scale of the cloud to centralize data and drive more value out of their data as a result.

## Unified analytics environment

Many users today want to establish a unified analytics environment across a myriad of expensive, on-premises data marts. Employing a wide range of disconnected tools and stop-gap measures creates data quality and security challenges. Cloud Data Fusion’s vast variety of connectors, visual interfaces, and abstractions centered around business logic helps in lowering TCO, promoting self-service and standardization, and reducing repetitive work.
