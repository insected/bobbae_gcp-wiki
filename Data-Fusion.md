Data Fusion is a fully managed, cloud-native, scalable data integration platform.

Data Fusion is built using open source project CDAP, and this open core ensures data pipeline portability for users. CDAP’s broad integration with on-premises and public cloud platforms gives Cloud Data Fusion users the ability to break down silos and deliver insights that were previously inaccessible.

## Modern, more secure data lakes on Google Cloud

Cloud Data Fusion helps users build scalable, distributed data lakes on Google Cloud by integrating data from siloed on-premises platforms. Customers can leverage the scale of the cloud to centralize data and drive more value out of their data as a result. The self-service capabilities of Cloud Data Fusion increase process visibility and lower the overall cost of operational support.

## Agile data warehouses with BigQuery

Cloud Data Fusion can help organizations better understand their customers by breaking down data silos and enabling development of agile, cloud-based data warehouse solutions in [BigQuery](BigQuery). A trusted, unified view of customer engagement and behavior unlocks the ability to drive a better customer experience, which leads to higher retention and higher revenue per customer.

## Unified analytics environment

Many users today want to establish a unified analytics environment across a myriad of expensive, on-premises data marts. Employing a wide range of disconnected tools and stop-gap measures creates data quality and security challenges. Cloud Data Fusion’s vast variety of connectors, visual interfaces, and abstractions centered around business logic helps in lowering TCO, promoting self-service and standardization, and reducing repetitive work.
