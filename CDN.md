## Cloud CDN

[Cloud CDN](https://cloud.google.com/cdn/) (Content Delivery Network) uses Google's globally distributed edge points of presence to cache external HTTP(S) load balanced content close to your users. Caching content at the edges of Google's network provides faster delivery of content to your users while reducing serving costs.

## HTTP/3 

HTTP/3 is a next-generation internet protocol, and is built on top of [QUIC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000).

HTTP/3 can [work with Cloud CDN and Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/cloud-cdn-and-load-balancing-support-http3).

## External HTTP(S) Load Balancing

Cloud CDN works with external HTTP(S) Load Balancing to deliver content to your users. The external HTTP(S) load balancer provides the frontend IP addresses and ports that receive requests and the backends (or origins) that respond to the requests.
