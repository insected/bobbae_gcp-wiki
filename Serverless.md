Google Cloud’s [serverless platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBw9vD_BO5A) lets you write code your way without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Deploy functions or apps as source code or as containers. 

Build full stack serverless applications with Google Cloud’s storage, databases, machine learning, and more. 

Easily extend applications with event-driven computing from Google or third-party service integrations. You can even choose to move your serverless workloads to on-premises environments or to the cloud.

## Choosing Serverless Option

## Cloud Run

[Cloud Run](Cloud-Run) is a managed compute platform that enables you to run stateless containers that can be invoked via web requests or Pub/Sub events. 



## App Engine

[App Engine](App-Engine) is a fully managed, serverless platform for developing and hosting web applications at scale. You can choose from several popular languages, libraries, and frameworks to develop your apps, then let App Engine take care of provisioning servers and scaling your app instances based on demand.

## Cloud Functions

[Google Cloud Functions](Cloud-Functions) is a [lightweight compute solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM-2O-uKBNQ) for developers to create single-purpose, stand-alone functions that respond to Cloud events without the need to manage a server or runtime environment.


## Knative

[Knative](Knative) extends [Kubernetes](Kubernetes-Engine-and-Containers) to provide a set of middleware components.


## Cloud Workflows and serverless tasks

You can use [Cloud Workflows](Workflows) to create serverless workflows that link a series of serverless tasks together in an order you define. Combine the power of Google Cloud's APIs, serverless products like Cloud Functions and Cloud Run, and calls to external APIs to create flexible serverless applications. Workflows require no infrastructure management and scales seamlessly with demand, including scaling down to zero.



Build serverless workflows orchestrating various products and API calls within Google Cloud and beyond.
