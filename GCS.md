[The Google Filesystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_File_System) Google File System (GFS or GoogleFS, not to be confused with the GFS Linux file system) is a proprietary distributed file system developed by Google to provide efficient, reliable access to data using large clusters of commodity hardware. The last version of [Google File System](https://research.google/pubs/pub51/) codenamed [Colossus](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/a-peek-behind-colossus-googles-file-system) was released in 2010.

In the [Big Data Chronicles](https://datafloq.com/read/big-data-history/239) and history, [the Google File System paper in 2003](https://research.google/pubs/pub51/) marked a seminal moment for software development. The Google File System paper started the Hadoop [Big Data](Big-Data) ecosystem.
