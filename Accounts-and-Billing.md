## Accounts & Billing

A Cloud Billing account defines who pays for a given set of Google Cloud resources. To use Google Cloud services, you must have a valid Cloud Billing account, and must link it to your Google Cloud projects. Your project's Google Cloud usage is charged to the linked Cloud Billing account.

Google Cloud resources are organized hierarchically. This hierarchy allows you to map your organization's operational structure to Google Cloud, and to manage access control and permissions for groups of related resources.

### Concepts

In the context of Google Cloud, a resource can refer to the service-level resources that are used to process your workloads (VMs, DBs, and so on) as well as to the account-level resources that sit above the services, such as projects, folders, and the organization.

### Sub Accounts

Subaccounts are intended for resellers. If you are a reseller, you can use subaccounts to represent your customers' charges for the purpose of chargebacks.

Cloud Billing subaccounts allow you to group charges from projects together on a separate section of your invoice. A billing subaccount is a Cloud Billing account that is owned by a reseller's parent Cloud Billing account. The usage charges for all billing subacccounts are paid for by the reseller's parent Cloud Billing account. Note that the parent Cloud Billing account must be on invoiced billing.

A subaccount behaves like a Cloud Billing account in most ways: it can have projects linked to it, Cloud Billing data exports can be configured on it, and it can have IAM roles defined on it. Any charges made to projects linked to the subaccount are grouped and subtotalled on the invoice, and the effect on resource management is that access control policy can be entirely segregated on the subaccount to allow for customer separation and management.
