## Preparation

This document is intended to be used in an instructor-lead training class on GCP.

### Qwiklabs

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew-r46FmzSM&list=PLIivdWyY5sqKOsBSMDTF0M76nXeChgh5D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew-r46FmzSM&list=PLIivdWyY5sqKOsBSMDTF0M76nXeChgh5D)

We will be using [Qwiklabs](https://www.qwiklabs.com/) as additional hands-on labs.  You should register using the  email address as your identity and create an account right away. It takes a few days to get the credits to be used for labs.


#### Qwiklabs Videos

### Register  Now at the Partner Advantage site

[https://www.partneradvantage.goog/GCPPRM/s/partneradvantageportallogin?language=en_US](https://www.partneradvantage.goog/GCPPRM/s/partneradvantageportallogin?language=en_US)

You may sign up as a new partner using your email address. You will receive a confirmation email after that. Often the confirmation email goes into the SPAM folder.  You may need to look for the email confirmation from Partner Advantage in your SPAM folder.

You may also fill out a form for Google training resources.

And go look around at

[https://googlecourses.qwiklabs.com/](https://googlecourses.qwiklabs.com/)

[A Tour of Qwiklabs and Google Cloud](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/2794?catalog_rank=%7B%22rank%22%3A1%2C%22num_filters%22%3A0%2C%22has_search%22%3Atrue%7D&parent=catalog&search_id=7467708)

If you donâ€™t get Qwiklabs credit in a few days, you can still sign up to use [free tier Google cloud services](https://cloud.google.com/free) and do the labs there.

### Codelabs

[Codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/) provide a guided, step-by-step learning experience on a wide range of topics on GCP.
Once you are comfortable with it, you may try [creating your own Codelab](https://medium.com/@zarinlo/publish-technical-tutorials-in-google-codelab-format-b07ef76972cd) tutorials. You may need [Codelab as a thing](https://github.com/zarinlo/tools).

### Git

If you are not familiar with git, you should learn to use it. You should create accounts using your  email address at [github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=w3jLJU7DT5E) and [gitlab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q9Y1Cv-ib0).

[Github flow ](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)is a way of using github.

[Gitlab flow ](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2014/09/29/gitlab-flow/)is a way of using gitlab.


### Certifications

You can try [GCP Cloud Architect exam](https://cloud.google.com/certification/guides/professional-cloud-architect) after studying the 
materials in this document for several weeks.  There are [many certificates](https://cloud.google.com/certification) you may want to try.
Being certified by Google does not necessarily mean that you know everything you need to know. But it does have a value in letting others
know that you have necessary amount of GCP knowledge to pass the exams.
