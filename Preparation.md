## Preparation

This document is intended to be used in an instructor-lead training class on GCP.

### Qwiklabs

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew-r46FmzSM&list=PLIivdWyY5sqKOsBSMDTF0M76nXeChgh5D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew-r46FmzSM&list=PLIivdWyY5sqKOsBSMDTF0M76nXeChgh5D)

We will be using [Qwiklabs](https://www.qwiklabs.com/) as additional hands-on labs.  You should register using the  email address as your identity and create an account right away. It takes a few days to get the credits to be used for labs.


#### Qwiklabs Videos

These videos may give you an idea of what Qwiklabs are like.

### Register  Now at the Partner Advantage site

If you are eligible as a partner of google you can sign up to get some Qwiklabs credits.

[https://www.partneradvantage.goog/GCPPRM/s/partneradvantageportallogin?language=en_US](https://www.partneradvantage.goog/GCPPRM/s/partneradvantageportallogin?language=en_US)

You may sign up as a new partner using your email address. You will receive a confirmation email after that. Often the confirmation email goes into the SPAM folder.  You may need to look for the email confirmation from Partner Advantage in your SPAM folder.

You may also fill out a form for Google training resources.

[https://inthecloud.withgoogle.com/partner-training/request-training-resources.html](https://inthecloud.withgoogle.com/partner-training/request-training-resources.html)

Another place to sign up for Qwiklabs credit if the above links do not work:

[https://inthecloud.withgoogle.com/training-discount/register.html](https://inthecloud.withgoogle.com/training-discount/register.html)

And go look around at

[https://googlecourses.qwiklabs.com/](https://googlecourses.qwiklabs.com/)

[A Tour of Qwiklabs and Google Cloud](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/2794?catalog_rank=%7B%22rank%22%3A1%2C%22num_filters%22%3A0%2C%22has_search%22%3Atrue%7D&parent=catalog&search_id=7467708)

If you don’t get Qwiklabs credit in a few days, you can still sign up to use [free tier Google cloud services](https://cloud.google.com/free) and do the labs there.

### Codelabs

[Codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/) provide a guided, step-by-step learning experience on a wide range of topics on GCP.
Once you are comfortable with it, you may try [creating your own Codelab](https://medium.com/@zarinlo/publish-technical-tutorials-in-google-codelab-format-b07ef76972cd) tutorials. You may need [Codelab as a thing](https://github.com/zarinlo/tools).

### Git

If you are not familiar with git, you should learn to use it. You should create accounts using your  email address at [github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=w3jLJU7DT5E) and [gitlab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q9Y1Cv-ib0).

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVsySz-h9r4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVsySz-h9r4)

[Github flow ](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)is a way of using github.

[Gitlab flow ](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2014/09/29/gitlab-flow/)is a way of using gitlab.


### Certifications

You can try [GCP Cloud Architect exam](https://cloud.google.com/certification/guides/professional-cloud-architect) after studying the 
materials in this document for several weeks.  There are [many certificates](https://cloud.google.com/certification) you may want to try.
Being certified by Google does not necessarily mean that you know everything you need to know. But it does have a value in letting others
know that you have necessary amount of GCP knowledge to pass the exams.

## Syllabus


### Course Description

This is a  course on GCP Infrastructure and services in general.  Trainees are expected to complete as much  of the material presented here during the eight week course. Example schedules for different types of GCP classes are provided.  


### Course Objectives

Upon completion the successful trainees will have taken and passed GCP Professional Cloud Architect certification exams or similar certificate exams in the appropriate study domains and pursue further studies in practice. The material here is intended to help the trainees to be productive  in their relevant fields as they continue to learn and improve GCP related skills.


### Course Outline

Besides the outlines of content that follow, the trainees are also given external resources such as Udemy, Coursera or Cloud Academy learning paths to be completed in parallel. 

The materials in this document are intended to cover a wide spectrum of areas of GCP.  You need to cover the breadth of what GCP offers but you also need to figure out which area you want to study in more detail. You will discover on your own the specific areas that are suited for you.  


### Group Project

If you are working as a group you can do a group project.
  The project will be conceived, designed, and implemented by the team consisting of the trainees.  We can present the work as part of the final completion requirement. The trainees are encouraged to advocate for themselves, proactively reaching out to other members of the  community.  

 We should communicate effectively to learn the needs of various practice teams and also administrative requirements  to come up with possible project ideas.  Coming up with project ideas is part of the project itself.  We can confirm the validity of our ideas by proposing specific remedies in the specific areas of concern. The project contents such as code, documentation and presentation materials should be placed into a git repository and google drive.  Github or gitlab repository can be used to contain all code, data, documentation, tests, videos of presentations and others.  They can also be made available via google drive for the people who have no github account.


### Daily Meetings

As much as possible there can be daily group meetings using Google meet, zoom or other tools to discuss the issues, questions and answers related to the learning process.  The goal is to unblock any problems each day, so as to make reasonable progress. 


### Worklog

Each participant will keep a log of their progress in written form. Please create a file in Google docs and share with the team to keep track of the learning progress and process. Use the doc to also keep track of questions and problems. We will also list out issues and questions to be discussed during the daily meeting. You can note any improvements and changes to be made to the curriculum as well. It is important to keep the log up to date on a daily basis.  Alternatively, instead of Google docs, you can create a git repo on github or gitlab and keep track of your work log and other materials to be shared with others.

 To spend the meeting time efficiently all questions and issues should be noted in writing before the daily meeting.  Often the issues can be resolved using a group chat discussion during the day. We will  participate in Google meet chat sessions for the duration of training.  Most of the communication will be done in the chat room, including most of the Q’s and A’s. 

We aim to have as much of the discussions in writing so that they may be used in the future by other students.  It is very important to keep track of the progress using the Worklog documents.  It can be used to review the materials later and keep track of questions and answers on different topics.


### Materials in this document

The following materials cover a wide range of GCP topics at different levels of depths. You should try to cover as much of them as deeply as possible. The topics are not necessarily in the order you may want to learn. They are organized somewhat but not to be strictly followed. Consume as you see fit. 

You may not have enough time to go through every video and Qwiklabs sessions.  You may have to skip some Qwiklabs and come back to them after you’ve gained more knowledge. You may pace yourself but please try to gain as much hands-on experience as possible as you move through the topics. Some topics can be learned briskly. Others require more attention. 

We will discuss the topics to be covered per day as we make progress during our daily meetings. 


### Example Schedules for 8 weeks programs

Here are some example 8 weeks programs that can be presented using the materials described in this document. Each topic is roughly equivalent to a chapter in this document.
