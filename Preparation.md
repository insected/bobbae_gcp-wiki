### Certifications

You are encouraged to try [GCP Cloud Architect exam](https://cloud.google.com/certification/guides/professional-cloud-architect) or [GCP Data Engineer exam](https://medium.com/@Fattie21/passing-the-google-data-engineer-professional-exam-in-4-days-76742fe11e52) after [studying the 
materials](https://cloud.google.com/certification/sample-questions/cloud-architect) in [this document](https://www.gcp-examquestions.com/category/gcp-practice-questions/) for several weeks.  There are [many certificates](https://cloud.google.com/certification) you may want to try.
Being [certified](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/training-certifications/learn-more-about-cloud-career-jump-start) by Google does not necessarily mean that you know everything [you need to know](https://github.com/ddneves/awesome-gcp-certifications). But it does have a value in letting others
know that you have the [necessary amount of GCP knowledge](https://www.examtopics.com/exams/google/) to pass the exams.



[Sign up]( https://cloud.google.com/certification/register  ) for the [Professional Cloud Architect exam](https://cloud.google.com/certification/guides/professional-cloud-architect) or [other GCP exams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kub0oH6TFKw) . During [the exam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Djgv5YTj1s) for the Cloud Architect Certification, some of the questions may refer you to [case studies](https://cloud.google.com/certification/guides/professional-cloud-architect/).
