[Cloud Tasks](https://cloud.google.com/tasks) lets you separate out pieces of work that can be performed independently, outside of your main application flow, and send them off to be processed, asynchronously, using handlers that you create.

These independent pieces of work are called tasks. For example, you need to update a database as part of processing a user request, but updates can be time-consuming. Offloading that detail as a task allows you to return from the request more quickly.
