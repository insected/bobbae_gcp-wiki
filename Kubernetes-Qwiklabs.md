### Security in GKE

The following hands-on labs focus on [security at scale](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/docs/concepts/anthos-overview#service_management) when deploying and managing production GKE environments -- specifically role-based access control, hardening, VPC networking, and binary authorization.

### Cloud Logging on GKE

Cloud Logging can be used aggregate logs from all Google Cloud resources, as well as any custom resources on other platforms, to allow for one centralized store for all logs and metrics. Logs are aggregated and then viewable within the provided Cloud Logging UI. They can also be [exported to Sinks](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export_v2) to support more specialized use cases. Currently, Cloud Logging supports exporting to the following sinks:


*   Cloud Storage
*   Pub/Sub
*   BigQuery

##### Deploy Kubernetes Load Balancer with Terraform

In Terraform, a Provider is the logical abstraction of an upstream API. This lab will show you how to set up a Kubernetes cluster and deploy a Load Balancer type NGINX service on it.

A favorite lab.
