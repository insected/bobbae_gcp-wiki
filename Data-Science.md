# Cloud Interference API

Time-series analysis is essential for day-to-day operation of many companies. Most popular use cases include analyzing foot traffic and conversion for retailers, detecting data anomalies, identifying correlations in real time over sensor data, or generating high-quality recommendations. With Cloud Inference API Alpha, you can gather insights in real time from your typed time-series datasets.

# Basic Bayes Theorem

Bayes' theorem, named after 18th-century British mathematician Thomas Bayes, is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probability. Conditional probability is the likelihood of an outcome occurring, based on a previous outcome occurring.

We can use probability to make predictions in machine learning. Perhaps the most widely used example is called the Naive Bayes algorithm. Not only is it straightforward to understand, but it also achieves surprisingly good results on a wide range of problems.

## Content Classification

Content Classification analyzes a document and returns a list of content categories that apply to the text found in the document.

## Classification, redaction, and de-identification

The Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP) helps you understand, manage, and protect sensitive data. With the Cloud DLP, you can easily classify and redact sensitive data contained in text-based content and images, including content stored in Google Cloud storage repositories.

# Document AI

Unlock insights from documents with machine learning. Tap into the opportunity offered by your unstructured data to increase operational efficiency, improve customer experience, and inform decision-making. Google Cloud’s Vision OCR (optical character recognition) and form parser technology uses [industry-leading](https://cloud.google.com/forrester-computer-vision) deep-learning neural network algorithms to perform text, character, and image recognition in over 200 languages with exceptional accuracy.

Using the same deep machine learning technology that powers Google Search and Assistant, Google Cloud’s natural language products enable you to derive valuable insights from your unstructured documents.
