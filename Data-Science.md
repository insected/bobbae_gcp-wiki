### Basic Bayes Theorem

Bayes' theorem, named after 18th-century British mathematician Thomas Bayes, is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probability. Conditional probability is the likelihood of an outcome occurring, based on a previous outcome occurring.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGCoVF3YvM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGCoVF3YvM)

We can use probability to make predictions in machine learning. Perhaps the most widely used example is called the Naive Bayes algorithm. Not only is it straightforward to understand, but it also achieves surprisingly good results on a wide range of problems.

Using AutoML to classify text.

#### Classification, redaction, and de-identification

The Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP) helps you understand, manage, and protect sensitive data. With the Cloud DLP, you can easily classify and redact sensitive data contained in text-based content and images, including content stored in Google Cloud storage repositories.

[https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/classification-redaction](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/classification-redaction)


### Scikit Learn

Whenever you perform classification, the first step is to understand the problem and identify potential features and labels. Features are those characteristics or attributes which affect the results of the label. For example, in the case of a loan distribution, bank manager's identify the customer's occupation, income, age, location, previous loan history, transaction history, and credit score. These characteristics are known as features which help the model classify customers.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvVkVsG49uU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvVkVsG49uU)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKLWy5zXe8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKLWy5zXe8)

The classification has two phases, a learning phase, and the evaluation phase. In the learning phase, the classifier trains its model on a given dataset and in the evaluation phase, it tests the classifier performance. Performance is evaluated on the basis of various parameters such as accuracy, error, precision, and recall.

They are defined in a [tf.Graph](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Graph) context. Since these graphs are data structures, they can be saved, run, and restored all without the original Python code.

### Keras


#### Introduction

Keras is an API designed for human beings, not machines. [Keras follows best practices for reducing cognitive load](https://blog.keras.io/user-experience-design-for-apis.html): it offers consistent & simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear and actionable feedback upon user error. This makes Keras easy to learn and easy to use. As a Keras user, you are more productive, allowing you to try more ideas than your competition, faster -- which in turn [helps you win machine learning competitions](https://www.quora.com/Why-has-Keras-been-so-successful-lately-at-Kaggle-competitions). This ease of use does not come at the cost of reduced flexibility: because Keras integrates deeply with low-level TensorFlow functionality, it enables you to develop highly hackable workflows where any piece of functionality can be customized.
