#### Datalab

With Cloud Datalab you'll be able to analyze your data on BigQuery, Cloud Machine Learning Engine, Compute Engine, and Cloud Storage using Python, SQL, and JavaScript (for BigQuery user-defined functions).

#### Reinforcement Learning

Like many other areas of machine learning research, [reinforcement learning (RL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) is evolving at breakneck speed. Just as they have done in other research areas, researchers are leveraging deep learning to achieve state-of-the-art results.

#### TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an open source software library for high performance numerical computation that's great for writing models that can train and run on platforms ranging from your laptop to a fleet of servers in the Cloud to an edge device. This quest takes you beyond the basics of using predefined models and teaches you how to build, train and deploy your own on GCP.

#### Kubeflow AI Platform Pipelines 

In this lab learn how to install and use Kubeflow Pipelines to orchestrate various Google Cloud Services in an end-to-end ML pipeline. Once Kubeflow Pipelines are installed you create an AI Platform Notebook and complete 2 example notebooks to demonstrate the services used and how to author a pipeline.
