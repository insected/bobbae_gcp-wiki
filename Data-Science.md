[Data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) is an [inter-disciplinary]( https://www.empiricaldata.org/dataladyblog/the-role-of-domain-knowledge-in-data-science  ) field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data, and apply knowledge and [actionable insights]( https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-data-science-4565e457cc17 ) from data across a [broad range of application domains](https://blog.ml.cmu.edu/2020/08/31/1-domain-knowledge/  ).


[Data Science](https://www.w3schools.com/datascience/default.asp) is about data gathering, analysis and decision-making.

## Data Analytics 

What's the [difference between Data Analytics vs Data Science]( https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/data-analytics-vs-data-science/)?  What is [the difference between  Data Science vs Data  Engineering]( https://blog.panoply.io/what-is-the-difference-between-a-data-engineer-and-a-data-scientist  )? In practical terms,  
there are significant overlapping areas of interest in data science, engineering  and analytics. 

GCP [smart analytics platform](  https://cloud.google.com/solutions/smart-analytics ) can help strip out layers of complexity and [analyze data  to solve problems](  https://cloud.google.com/architecture/reference-patterns/overview ) in broad areas of applications such as [anomaly detection](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/reference-patterns/overview#anomaly_detection), [data monetization](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/reference-patterns/overview#data_monetization
), [general analytics](
https://cloud.google.com/architecture/reference-patterns/overview#general_analytics), [log analytics](  https://cloud.google.com/architecture/reference-patterns/overview#log_analytics), [pattern recognition](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/reference-patterns/overview#pattern_recognition), [predictive forecasting](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/reference-patterns/overview#predictive_forecasting), [real-time clickstream analytics](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/reference-patterns/overview#real-time_clickstream_analytics),  [time-series analytics](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/reference-patterns/overview#time_series_analytics) and [working with data lakes](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/reference-patterns/overview#working_with_data_lakes).


These [topics]( https://www.jeremyjordan.me/data-science/ ) require [diverse range of knowledge and skills  from many disciplines](https://www.explorium.ai/blog/domain-knowledge-in-data-science-are-your-models-ready-for-business/  ).
