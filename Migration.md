[Migrating](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/migration-center
) a workload from a legacy on-premises environment or private hosting environment to a cloud-native environment, such as a public cloud, can be challenging and risky. Successful migrations change the workload to migrate as little as possible during the migration operations. Moving legacy on-premises apps to the cloud often requires multiple migration steps.

### Velostrata

[Google Cloud Migrate for Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/compute-engine) (formerly Velostrata) migrates VMs from your on-premises data center, AWS, or Azure into Compute Engine.

https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/velostrata

Migrate for Compute Engine enables you to migrate  your virtual machines (VMs), with minor automatic modifications, from your source environment to Google Compute Engine. Migrate for Compute Engine uses data replication technology which continuously replicates disk data from the source VMs to Google Cloud without causing any downtime on the source. You then create VM clones from replicated data for testing and perform predictable VM cut-over to your final workloads running on Google Cloud.

Data replication allows Migrate for Compute Engine to perform an initial replication of the data from the source VM so that you can quickly clone and test a migrated VM. However, because the source VM continues to run during the migration process, including during testing, Migrate for Compute Engine continues to replicate data until you perform the final cut over to your migrated VM.

### General VM Migration issues

Compute Engine enables [Live Migration](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2015/03/Google-Compute-Engine-uses-Live-Migration-technology-to-service-infrastructure-without-application-downtime.html) which can allow your instances migrated automatically when the physical hardware requires maintenance.

As with standard hypervisor suites, Compute Engine also allows you to [take live snapshots of VM](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/create-snapshots) instances. You can use these snapshots to create new instances within a zone or move an instance to a different zone.


If your Compute Engine VM instance is terminated due to issues with the underlying physical host, the instance will recover automatically on a different host within the same zone. You can also elect to have your machines stay down by turning off [automatic restart](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/setting-instance-scheduling-options#autorestart).
