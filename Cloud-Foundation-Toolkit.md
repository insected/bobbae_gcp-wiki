The [Cloud Foundation Toolkit](https://cloud.google.com/foundation-toolkit)  provides a series of reference templates for Deployment Manager and Terraform which reflect Google Cloud best practices. These templates can be used off-the-shelf to quickly build a repeatable enterprise-ready foundation in Google Cloud. This frees you to focus on deploying your applications on this baseline secure environment. And with [infrastructure as code](infrastructure-as-code), you can easily update the foundation as your needs change.

The [Cloud Foundation toolkit](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-toolkit) (CFT) includes the following parts:

- A comprehensive set of production-ready resource templates that follow
  Google's best practices, which can be used with the CFT or the gcloud
  utility 
- A [command-line interface]( https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-toolkit/tree/master/cli
 ) (henceforth, CLI) that deploys resources defined in
  single or multiple CFT-compliant config files.
- A growing set of sample [Config
  Connector](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/overview)
  YAML configurations
- a sample pipeline that enables running CFT deployment operations from Jenkins.
