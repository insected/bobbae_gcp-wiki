The Cloud Foundation Toolkit provides a series of reference templates for Deployment Manager and Terraform which reflect Google Cloud best practices. These templates can be used off-the-shelf to quickly build a repeatable enterprise-ready foundation in Google Cloud. This frees you to focus on deploying your applications on this baseline secure environment. And with infrastructure as code, you can easily update the foundation as your needs change.

The [Cloud Foundation toolkit](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-toolkit) (henceforth, CFT) includes the following parts:

- A comprehensive set of production-ready resource templates that follow
  Google's best practices, which can be used with the CFT or the gcloud
  utility 
- A command-line interface (henceforth, CLI) that deploys resources defined in
  single or multiple CFT-compliant config files.
- A growing set of sample [Config
  Connector](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/overview)
  YAML configurations
- a sample pipeline that enables running CFT deployment operations from Jenkins.
