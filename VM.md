A virtual machine (VM) is an [emulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator) of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on [computer architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architectures) and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination. A VM is a kind of [hypervisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor). The [distinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor#Classification) between Type-1 and Type-2 hypervisor can sometimes be not clear.

## Google Compute Engine and KVM

Google Compute Engine uses KVM as the hypervisor.
The [KVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine) may be categorized as both Type-1 and Type-2.


## VM Manager

VM Manager is a suite of tools that can be used to manage operating systems for large virtual machine (VM) fleets running Windows and Linux on Compute Engine.
## Nested VM

It is possible to run [nested VM](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/enable-nested-virtualization-vm-instances) instances in GCP.



## Intel VT-x and AMD SVM
