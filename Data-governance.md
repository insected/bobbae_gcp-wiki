[Data governance](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-data-governance) is a principled approach to managing data during its life cycle, from acquisition to use to disposal. 

 Your data governance program clearly outlines policies, procedures, responsibilities, and controls surrounding data activities. This program helps to ensure that information is collected, maintained, used, and disseminated in such a way that both meets your organization's data integrity and security needs, and also helps empower your employees to discover and use the data to its fullest potential.

From when the data is ingested to when it can be used for valuable insights and information, management and governance of the data should be considered with the utmost importance for any organization.
