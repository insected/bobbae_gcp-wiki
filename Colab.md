# Introduction

Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research. 
Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education. 

More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs.

# Jupyter notebook

A live Colab jupyter lab notebook can be run at:

[Getting started: Training and prediction with Keras in AI Platform](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudml-samples/blob/master/notebooks/tensorflow/getting-started-keras.ipynb)

Please note that any ipynb file hosted on github can be hosted on colab.
