Cloud Build executes your build as a series of build steps, where each build step is run in a Docker container. A build step can do anything that can be done from a container irrespective of the environment. To perform your tasks, you can either [use the supported build steps](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/configuring-builds/build-test-deploy-artifacts) provided by Cloud Build or [write your own build steps](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/create-custom-build-steps).
