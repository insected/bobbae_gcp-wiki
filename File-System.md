## File Storage

File storage—also called file-level or file-based storage—is a hierarchical storage methodology used to organize and store data on a computer hard drive or on [network-attached storage](NAS) (NAS) device. In file storage, data is stored in files, the files are organized in folders, and the folders are organized under a hierarchy of directories and subdirectories. To locate a file, all you or your computer system need is the path—from directory to subdirectory to folder to file.

### Linux Filesystems

The majority of modern Linux distributions default to the ext4 filesystem, just as previous Linux distributions defaulted to ext3, ext2, and—if you go back far enough—ext.

If you're new to Linux—or to filesystems—you might wonder what ext4 brings to the table that ext3 didn't.

You might also wonder whether ext4 is still in active development at all, given the flurries of news coverage of alternate filesystems such as [Btrfs](https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page), [XFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFS), and [ZFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS).

### Flash file systems

A [flash file system](Flash-File-System) is a file system designed for storing files on flash memory–based storage devices.



## GCP Filestore

[Filestore](Filestore) instances are fully managed [NFS](NFS) based [file servers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rS8O2RiT80) on Google Cloud  for use with applications running on Compute Engine virtual machines  instances or Google Kubernetes Engine clusters.



You can create and manage [Filestore](https://cloud.google.com/filestore/docs) instances by using the Google Cloud Console or the [gcloud command-line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/filestore), and interact with the [NFS file share](https://cloud.google.com/filestore/docs/nfs) on the instance by using standard operating system commands.
