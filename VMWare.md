[VMware]( http://vmware.com/  ) was the first commercially successful company to virtualize the x86 architecture.

VMware's most notable products are its [hypervisors](Hypervisor). VMware became well known for its first type 2 hypervisor known as GSX. This product has since evolved into two hypervisor product lines: VMware's type 1 hypervisors running directly on hardware and their hosted type 2 hypervisors.
