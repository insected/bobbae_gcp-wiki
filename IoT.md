Events of interest [fire off continuously](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51bq_Yhuof4 ) in the physical world, and data that is material to decision making can’t always wait for offline analysis. 

[Internet-equipped sensors](https://cloud.google.com/community/tutorials/monitoring-iot-data-grafana ) on any physical item imaginable make it possible to ingest data continuously into the cloud, directly from the source at a massive scale. 

### IoT Operating Systems

[IoT operating systems](https://www.g2.com/categories/iot-operating-systems
) allow users to perform the basic functions of a computer within an internet-connected device. 

IoT operating systems are embedded within IoT devices and connect to a greater network of devices.
