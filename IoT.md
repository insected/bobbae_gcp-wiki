### IoT Core

[Google Cloud Internet of Things (IoT) Core](https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs  ) is a fully managed service for securely connecting and managing IoT devices, from a few to millions. Ingest data from connected devices and build rich applications that integrate with the other big data services of Google Cloud Platform.

Events of interest fire off continuously in the physical world, and data that is material to decision making can’t always wait for offline analysis. Internet-equipped sensors on any physical item imaginable make it possible to ingest data continuously into the cloud, directly from the source at massive scale.
