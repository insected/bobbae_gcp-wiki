[Artificial Intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/)   systems demonstrate at least some of the following behaviors associated with human intelligence: planning, learning, reasoning, problem solving, knowledge representation, perception, motion, and manipulation and, to a lesser extent, social intelligence and creativity.

At a very high level, [artificial intelligence](https://docs.paperspace.com/machine-learning/) can be split into two broad types: narrow AI and general AI.

The [narrow AI](https://hackernoon.com/general-vs-narrow-ai-3d0d02ef3e28 ) is what we see all around us in computers today: intelligent systems that have been taught or have learned how to carry out specific tasks without being explicitly programmed how to do so.

[General AI]( https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/an-executive-primer-on-artificial-general-intelligence# ) is very different, and is the type of adaptable intellect found in humans, a flexible form of intelligence capable of learning how to carry out vastly different tasks, anything from haircutting to building spreadsheets, or reasoning about a wide variety of topics based on its accumulated experience.

## AI Hub

[AI Hub](AI-Hub)  offers a collection of components for developers and data scientists building AI systems. 

### AI Hub vs. TensorFlow Hub

[TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub) provides a library of TensorFlow modules that you can use to speed up the process of training your model. On the AI Hub, you can explore and use a variety of AI asset categories.


# AI Ethics 

The ways in which artificial intelligence is built and deployed will significantly affect society. 

We are living in times when it is paramount that the [possibility of harm](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/04/29/nijeer-parks-facial-recognition-arrest-orig.cnn-business ) in AI systems has to be recognized and addressed quickly. Thus, [identifying the potential risks](https://futureoflife.org/background/benefits-risks-of-artificial-intelligence/), [bias](https://www.educative.io/blog/racial-bias-machine-learning-algorithms), [privacy](Privacy) and [security](Security) issues caused by AI systems means a plan of measures to counteract them has to be adopted as soon as possible.
