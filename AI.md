[Artificial Intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/)   systems demonstrate at least some of the following behaviors associated with human intelligence: planning, learning, reasoning, problem solving, knowledge representation, perception, motion, and manipulation and, to a lesser extent, social intelligence and creativity.

At a very high level, [artificial intelligence](https://docs.paperspace.com/machine-learning/) can be split into two broad types: narrow AI and general AI.

The narrow AI is what we see all around us in computers today: intelligent systems that have been taught or have learned how to carry out specific tasks without being explicitly programmed how to do so.

General AI is very different, and is the type of adaptable intellect found in humans, a flexible form of intelligence capable of learning how to carry out vastly different tasks, anything from haircutting to building spreadsheets, or reasoning about a wide variety of topics based on its accumulated experience. 


## AI Ethics 

The ways in which artificial intelligence is built and deployed will significantly affect society. 

We are living in times when it is paramount that the possibility of harm in AI systems has to be recognized and addressed quickly. Thus, [identifying the potential risks](https://futureoflife.org/background/benefits-risks-of-artificial-intelligence/), [bias](https://www.educative.io/blog/racial-bias-machine-learning-algorithms), [privacy](Privacy) and [security](Security) issues caused by AI systems means a plan of measures to counteract them has to be adopted as soon as possible.
