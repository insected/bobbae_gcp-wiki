[Artificial Intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/)   systems demonstrate at least some of the following behaviors associated with human intelligence: planning, learning, reasoning, problem solving, knowledge representation, perception, motion, and manipulation and, to a lesser extent, social intelligence and creativity.

At a very high level, [artificial intelligence](https://docs.paperspace.com/machine-learning/) can be split into two broad types: narrow AI and general AI.

The [narrow AI](https://hackernoon.com/general-vs-narrow-ai-3d0d02ef3e28 ) is what we see all around us in computers today: intelligent systems that have been taught or have learned how to carry out specific tasks without being explicitly programmed how to do so.

[General AI]( https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/an-executive-primer-on-artificial-general-intelligence# ) is very different, and is the type of adaptable intellect found in humans, a flexible form of intelligence capable of learning how to carry out vastly different tasks, anything from haircutting to building spreadsheets, or reasoning about a wide variety of topics based on its accumulated experience.

## Vertex AI

[Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/introduction-unified-platform) brings [AutoML](AutoML) and [AI Platform](AI-Platform) together into a unified API, client library, and user interface. With Vertex AI, both AutoML training and custom training are available options. 

https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs

## AutoML vs. custom training


AutoML lets you create and train a [Machine Learning](Machine-Learning) model with minimal technical effort. Even if you want the flexibility of a custom training application, you can use AutoML to quickly prototype models and explore new datasets before investing in development. For example, you can use it to learn which are good features in a dataset.

Custom training lets you create a training application optimized for your targeted outcome. You have complete control over training application functionality; you can target any objective, use any algorithm, develop your own loss functions or metrics, or do any other customization.

## Migrating to Vertex AI

Vertex AI supports all features and models available in AutoML and AI Platform. However, the client libraries do not support client integration backward compatibility. In other words, you must plan to migrate your resources to benefit from Vertex AI features.

## Migrating Applications to Vertex AI

API  changes you need to make when you migrate your applications from AutoML or AI Platform to Vertex AI.

## Vertex Pipelines


[MLOps](MLOps) is the practice of applying DevOps strategies to [Machine Learning](Machine-Learning) systems. DevOps strategies let you efficiently build and release code changes, and monitor systems to ensure you meet your reliability goals. MLOps extends this practice to help you reduce the amount of time that it takes to reliably go from data ingestion to deploying your model in production, in a way that lets you monitor and understand your ML system.

Vertex Pipelines helps you to automate, monitor, and govern your ML systems by orchestrating your ML workflow in a serverless manner, and storing your workflow's artifacts using Vertex ML Metadata. By storing the artifacts of your ML workflow in Vertex ML Metadata, you can analyze the lineage of your workflow's artifacts â€” for example, an ML model's lineage may include the training data, hyperparameters, and code that were used to create the model.

## AI Ethics 

The ways in which artificial intelligence is built and deployed will significantly affect society. 

We are living in times when it is paramount that the [possibility of harm](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/04/29/nijeer-parks-facial-recognition-arrest-orig.cnn-business ) in AI systems has to be recognized and addressed quickly. Thus, [identifying the potential risks](https://futureoflife.org/background/benefits-risks-of-artificial-intelligence/), [bias](https://www.educative.io/blog/racial-bias-machine-learning-algorithms), [privacy](Privacy) and [security](Security) issues caused by AI systems means a plan of measures to counteract them has to be adopted as soon as possible.
