[Artificial Intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/)   systems demonstrate at least some of the following behaviours associated with human intelligence: planning, learning, reasoning, problem solving, knowledge representation, perception, motion, and manipulation and, to a lesser extent, social intelligence and creativity.

At a very high level, [artificial intelligence](https://docs.paperspace.com/machine-learning/) can be split into two broad types: narrow AI and general AI.

The narrow AI is what we see all around us in computers today: intelligent systems that have been taught or have learned how to carry out specific tasks without being explicitly programmed how to do so.

General AI is very different, and is the type of adaptable intellect found in humans, a flexible form of intelligence capable of learning how to carry out vastly different tasks, anything from haircutting to building spreadsheets, or reasoning about a wide variety of topics based on its accumulated experience. 



## Google  AI

[Google AI](https://ai.google/) is making it easier for people to do things every day, whether it’s searching for photos of loved ones, breaking down language barriers in [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/), typing emails on the go, or getting things done with the [Google Assistant](https://assistant.google.com/). AI also provides new ways of looking at existing problems, from rethinking healthcare to advancing scientific discovery. Google [AI Hub](AI-Hub) and [AI Platform](AI-Platform) provide useful services to Google Cloud Platform users.

## AI Winter  & Resurgence 


The [beginnings of modern AI](https://www.livescience.com/49007-history-of-artificial-intelligence.html) can be traced to [classical philosophers' attempts to describe human thinking](https://towardsdatascience.com/rise-and-fall-of-symbolic-ai-6b7abd2420f2) as a symbolic system. But the field of AI wasn't formally founded until 1956, at a [conference at Dartmouth College](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop).

MIT cognitive scientist Marvin Minsky, [John McCarthy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)) and others who attended the conference were extremely optimistic but 1974–80 [AI Winter](https://towardsdatascience.com/history-of-the-first-ai-winter-6f8c2186f80b) was followed by another winter from 1987 to 1993, coinciding with the collapse of the market for some of the early general-purpose computers, and reduced government funding.

AI is in resurgence partly due to Google and [Machine Learning](Machine-Learning). 
 
Also there's the famous Moore’s Law according to which the number of transistors per integrated circuit doubles every two years. An immediate corollary of this law is the exponential increase of processing power that now benefits AI. 

Another reason is the no-less exponential increase of data and, in particular, labeled data. The market size of data collection and labeling has reached in 2019 a whopping value of 1 billion USD. Experiments on 300 million images  revealed that the accuracy of deep neural nets increases logarithmically with the training set size. Said otherwise, the generalization capabilities of deep neural nets do not seem to have a plateau.

Although discovered in the late 1980’s, it was in 2012, when the team of Geoffrey Hinton won the [ImageNet challenge](https://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/), that the [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://docs.paperspace.com/machine-learning/wiki/convolutional-neural-network-cnn) set the prairie on fire. Since then, CNNs have been the tool of choice for analyzing images of all kinds.


## AI Ethics 

The ways in which artificial intelligence is built and deployed will significantly affect society. 

We are living in times when it is paramount that the possibility of harm in AI systems has to be recognized and addressed quickly. Thus, [identifying the potential risks](https://futureoflife.org/background/benefits-risks-of-artificial-intelligence/)  and [bias](https://www.educative.io/blog/racial-bias-machine-learning-algorithms) caused by AI systems means a plan of measures to counteract them has to be adopted as soon as possible.
