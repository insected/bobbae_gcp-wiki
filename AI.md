[Artificial Intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/)   systems demonstrate at least some of the following behaviors associated with human intelligence: planning, learning, reasoning, problem solving, knowledge representation, perception, motion, and manipulation and, to a lesser extent, social intelligence and creativity.

At a very high level, [artificial intelligence](https://docs.paperspace.com/machine-learning/) can be split into two broad types: narrow AI and general AI.

The [narrow AI](https://hackernoon.com/general-vs-narrow-ai-3d0d02ef3e28 ) is what we see all around us in computers today: intelligent systems that have been taught or have learned how to carry out specific tasks without being explicitly programmed how to do so.

[General AI]( https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/an-executive-primer-on-artificial-general-intelligence# ) is very different, and is the type of adaptable intellect found in humans, a flexible form of intelligence capable of learning how to carry out vastly different tasks, anything from haircutting to building spreadsheets, or reasoning about a wide variety of topics based on its accumulated experience.

# Vertex AI

Vertex AI brings [AutoML](AutoML) and [AI Platform](AI-Platform) together into a unified API, client library, and user interface. With Vertex AI, both AutoML training and custom training are available options.

## Vertex Pipelines


[MLOps](MLOps) is the practice of applying DevOps strategies to [Machine Learning](Machine-Learning) systems. DevOps strategies let you efficiently build and release code changes, and monitor systems to ensure you meet your reliability goals. MLOps extends this practice to help you reduce the amount of time that it takes to reliably go from data ingestion to deploying your model in production, in a way that lets you monitor and understand your ML system.

Vertex Pipelines helps you to automate, monitor, and govern your ML systems by orchestrating your ML workflow in a serverless manner, and storing your workflow's artifacts using Vertex ML Metadata. By storing the artifacts of your ML workflow in Vertex ML Metadata, you can analyze the lineage of your workflow's artifacts â€” for example, an ML model's lineage may include the training data, hyperparameters, and code that were used to create the model.

# AI Ethics 

The ways in which artificial intelligence is built and deployed will significantly affect society. 

We are living in times when it is paramount that the [possibility of harm](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/04/29/nijeer-parks-facial-recognition-arrest-orig.cnn-business ) in AI systems has to be recognized and addressed quickly. Thus, [identifying the potential risks](https://futureoflife.org/background/benefits-risks-of-artificial-intelligence/), [bias](https://www.educative.io/blog/racial-bias-machine-learning-algorithms), [privacy](Privacy) and [security](Security) issues caused by AI systems means a plan of measures to counteract them has to be adopted as soon as possible.
