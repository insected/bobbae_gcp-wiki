A cloud-hosted [key management](https://cloud.google.com/security-key-management) service that lets you manage symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic keys for your cloud services the same way you do on-premises. You can generate, use, rotate, and destroy AES256, RSA 2048, RSA 3072, RSA 4096, EC P256, and EC P384 cryptographic keys. Toggle between software- and hardware-protected encryption keys with the press of a button. Host encryption keys and perform cryptographic operations in FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified HSMs. With this fully managed service, you can protect your most sensitive workloads without the need to worry about the operational overhead of managing an HSM cluster. 

Encrypt data in [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) and [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute) with encryption keys that are stored and managed in a third-party key management system that’s deployed outside Google’s infrastructure. External Key Manager allows you to maintain separation between your data at rest and your encryption keys while still leveraging the power of cloud for compute and analytics. 

Key Access Justifications works with [Cloud EKM](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/cloud-external-key-manager-now-in-beta) to greatly advance the control you have over your data. It’s the only product that gives you visibility into every request for an encryption key, a justification for that request, and a mechanism to approve or deny decryption in the context of that request. 


Learn about how Google automatically encrypts your data and how to take control of encryption by managing your own keys.
