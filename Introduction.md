## Google Cloud Platform


### Introduction

Google Cloud Platform offers four main kinds of services: Compute, Storage, Big Data, and Machine Learning.

GCP also includes Google App Engine, Google Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Google Cloud Storage, Google Cloud SQL, and BigQuery. You will learn about important resource and policy management tools, such as the Google Cloud Resource Manager hierarchy and Google Cloud Identity and Access Management.

#### Regions and Zones

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/gcp_global_presence.max-1600x1600.jpg" width="800">

Google Cloud consists of a set of physical assets, such as computers and hard disk drives, and virtual resources, such as virtual machines (VMs), that are contained in [Google's data centers](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/infrastructure/explore) around the globe. 

https://cloud.google.com/about/locations

Each data center location is in a region. Regions are available in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. Each region is a collection of zones, which are isolated from each other within the region. Each zone is identified by a name that combines a letter identifier with the name of the region. For example, zone a in the East Asia region is named asia-east1-a. This distribution of resources provides several benefits, including redundancy in case of failure and reduced latency by locating resources closer to clients.

This distribution also introduces some rules about how resources can be used together. When architecting your apps in GCP, itâ€™s important to understand [regions and zones](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/global-regional-zonal-resources), as well as the resources that are regional or zonal. While some of the core resources in GCP are global, others may be restricted by region or zone.

Regional resources can be used anywhere within the same region, while zonal resources can be used anywhere within the same zone.

### Basic Tools


#### Cloud SDK

Google Cloud SDK is a set of tools that you can use to manage resources and applications hosted on Google Cloud. These include the [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference), [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil), and [bq](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/bq-command-line-tool) command line tools. The gcloud command-line tool is downloaded along with the Cloud SDK; a comprehensive guide to the gcloud CLI can be found in [gcloud command-line tool overview](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud).

[https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs)
