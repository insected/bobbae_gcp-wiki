[Google Cloud](  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D3X6Xl5c_Y ) consists of a set of [assets]( https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/  )  that are contained in Google's [secure infrastructure](  https://blog.google/inside-google/infrastructure/how-data-center-security-works/ ) around [the globe](  https://cloud.withgoogle.com/infrastructure  ).

[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) offers these main kinds of [products](https://cloud.google.com/products) and [services](  https://gcp.solutions/ ): [Compute](Compute), [Storage](Storage), [Big Data](Big-Data), [AI Platform](AI-Platform) and [Machine Learning](Machine-Learning). 


[GCP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmOMataJZWw) also [includes](  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJS9pqu9BzkAMNTmzNMNhvg/playlists  ) Google [App Engine](App-Engine), Google [Compute Engine](Compute), Google [Kubernetes Engine](GKE), Google [Cloud Storage](Storage), Google [Cloud SQL]( CloudSQL  ), and [BigQuery](BigQuery). There are resource and policy management tools, such as the Google [Cloud Resource Manager](  https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager ) hierarchy and Google Cloud [Identity and Access Management](  IAM). 

GCP has been around since [2008]( https://medium.com/@retomeier/an-annotated-history-of-googles-cloud-platform-90b90f948920
   ) and benefitted from [fundamental research ](https://research.google/) that continue to [influence the  product](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/google-clouds-iaas-platform-is-a-powerful-choice) development.

## Regions and Zones



Each [data center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZmGGAbHqa0) [location](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations) is in a region. Regions are available in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. Each region is a collection of zones, which are [isolated from each other](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/scalable-and-resilient-apps) within the region. When architecting your apps in GCP, itâ€™s important to understand [regions and zones](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations), as well as the [resources that are regional or zonal](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/global-regional-zonal-resources). While some of the core resources in GCP are global, others may be restricted by [region or zone](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/global-regional-zonal-resources).

## Basic Tools


### Cloud SDK

Google [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs) is a set of tools that you can use to manage resources and applications hosted on Google Cloud. These include the [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference), [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil), and [bq](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/bq-command-line-tool) command line tools. The [gcloud command-line tool](https://dominicusin.github.io/2019/07/25/gcloud-cheat-sheet.html) is downloaded along with the Cloud SDK; a comprehensive guide to the gcloud CLI can be found in [gcloud command-line tool overview](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud).


Learn more about the integrated [command line tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69MdTXgA6Ws) to help manage resources and apps on Google Cloud. Try the [Google Cloud SDK: Qwik Start lab](http://bit.ly/2vm0rKN).




### Cloud Shell

Google [Cloud Shell](Cloud-Shell) is an [interactive shell](   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7bXH_2X760 ) environment for Google Cloud Platform that makes it easy for you to learn and experiment with GCP and manage your projects and resources from your web browser.
