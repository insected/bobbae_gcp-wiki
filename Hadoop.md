[Apache Hadoop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Hadoop) is a collection of open-source software utilities that facilitates using a network of many computers to solve problems involving massive amounts of data and computation. 

## Basic introduction to Apache Hadoop

### Map reduce job example

You can [see how to]( https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/how-to-install-and-set-up-hadoop-cluster/) create a small three node Hadoop cluster and submit map reduce example.

### MrJob

[mrjob](https://mrjob.readthedocs.io/) lets you write MapReduce jobs in Python 2.7/3.4+ and run them on several platforms. 


## Hive

[Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/) is a data warehouse software project built on top of Apache Hadoop for providing data query and analysis.

Apache Hive is considered [similar]( https://blog.clairvoyantsoft.com/bigquery-fundamentals-and-its-benefits-over-hive-hadoop-c3d53e4d2b8f ) to BigQuery.


## Hadoop Pig 

[Apache Pig](http://pig.apache.org/) is a platform for analyzing large data sets that consists of a high-level language for expressing data analysis programs, coupled with infrastructure for evaluating these programs.

## Pig Latin SQL Challenge

Doing ETL in SQL or [Pig Latin](https://pig.apache.org/docs/latest/basic.html) to give more detailed feel for why one might prefer one or the other in solving actual common problems:

## Sawzall

A perspective on Sawzall DSL (domain specific language) over Google map/reduce and Pig DSL over Hadoop map/reduce.

And finally a perspective on replacing Sawzell within Google.
