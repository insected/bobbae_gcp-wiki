### Introduction

[Keras](https://keras.io/)     is an [awesome](https://github.com/gym0569/awesome-keras) library that wraps the efficient numerical computation libraries [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano) and [TensorFlow](Tensorflow). Keras is a higher-level deep learning framework, which abstracts many details away, making code simpler and more concise than in [PyTorch](PyTorch) or TensorFlow, at the cost of limited hackability. Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation.  It abstracts away the computation backend, which can be TensorFlow, Theano or [CNTK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/). It does not support a [PyTorch](PyTorch) backend.

It allows you to define and train neural network models in just a few lines of code.

Keras is the high-level API of TensorFlow 2: an approachable, highly-productive interface for solving machine learning problems, with a focus on modern deep learning. It provides essential abstractions and building blocks for developing and shipping machine learning solutions with high iteration velocity.

Keras empowers engineers and researchers to take full advantage of the scalability and cross-platform capabilities of TensorFlow 2: you can run Keras on TPU or on large clusters of GPUs, and you can export your Keras models to run in the browser or on a mobile device.
