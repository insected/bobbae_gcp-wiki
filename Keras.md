# Introduction

Keras is an API designed for human beings, not machines. [Keras follows best practices for reducing cognitive load](https://blog.keras.io/user-experience-design-for-apis.html): it offers consistent & simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear and actionable feedback upon user error. This makes Keras easy to learn and easy to use. As a Keras user, you are more productive, allowing you to try more ideas than your competition, faster -- which in turn [helps you win machine learning competitions](https://www.quora.com/Why-has-Keras-been-so-successful-lately-at-Kaggle-competitions). This ease of use does not come at the cost of reduced flexibility: because Keras integrates deeply with low-level TensorFlow functionality, it enables you to develop highly hackable workflows where any piece of functionality can be customized.
