### Introduction

[Keras](https://keras.io/)  is the high-level API of Tensorflow 2. Keras    is an [awesome](https://github.com/gym0569/awesome-keras) library that wraps the efficient numerical computation libraries [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano) and [TensorFlow](Tensorflow). Keras is a higher-level deep learning framework, which abstracts many details away, making code simpler and more concise than in [PyTorch](PyTorch) or Tensorflow, at the cost of limited hackability.

Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation.  It abstracts away the computation backend, which can be Tensorflow, Theano or [CNTK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/). It does not support a [PyTorch](PyTorch) backend. It allows you to define and train neural network models in just a few lines of code.
