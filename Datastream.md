[Datastream](  https://cloud.google.com/datastream/docs/overview ) is a serverless and easy-to-use change data capture (CDC) and replication service. It allows you to synchronize data across heterogeneous databases and applications reliably, and with minimal latency and downtime.

Datastream supports streaming from Oracle and MySQL databases into Cloud Storage. The service offers streamlined integration with Dataflow templates to power up-to-date materialized views in BigQuery for analytics, replicate your databases into Cloud SQL or Cloud Spanner for database synchronization, or leverage the event stream directly from Cloud Storage to realize event-driven architectures.
