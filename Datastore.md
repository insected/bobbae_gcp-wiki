# Forestore in Datastore mode

Firestore in Datastore mode is a NoSQL document database built for automatic scaling, high performance, and ease of application development.

Firestore is the newest version of Datastore and introduces [several improvements over Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/firestore-or-datastore#in_native_mode). 

Existing Datastore users can access these improvements by creating a new Firestore in Datastore mode database instance. In the future, all existing Datastore databases will be [automatically upgraded to Firestore in Datastore mode](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/upgrade-to-firestore).

While the Datastore mode interface has many of the same features as traditional databases, as a NoSQL database it differs from them in the way it describes relationships between data objects.
