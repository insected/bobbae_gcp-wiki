[Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore) is a highly scalable NoSQL  document database for your applications. Datastore automatically handles sharding and replication, providing you with a highly available and durable database that scales automatically to handle your applications' load. Datastore provides a myriad of capabilities such as ACID transactions, SQL-like queries and indexes.  



## Evolution of Datastore

Cloud Datastore is built upon Google's [Bigtable](Bigtable) and [Megastore](https://research.google/pubs/pub36971/) technology. Datastore allows the user to create databases either in Native or Datastore Mode. Native Mode is designed for mobile and web apps, while Datastore Mode is designed for new server projects.

Originally released as a feature in Google App Engine in 2008, Cloud Datastore was announced as a standalone product in 2013 during Google I/O. 

In 2018 at the Google Cloud Next conference, the second-generation [Firestore](Firestore) database was opened to general availability, with a backward-compatibility mode. 

Google provides a path for automatically upgrading a legacy Datastore database to [Firestore in Datastore mode](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs).

## GQL

https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/reference/gql_reference

Cloud Datastore database has a SQL-like syntax called "GQL" (Google Query Language). GQL does not support the Join statement. Instead, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships can be accomplished using ReferenceProperty(). This shared-nothing approach allows disks to fail without the system failing. Switching from a relational database to Cloud Datastore requires a paradigm shift for developers when modeling their data.




## Firestore in Datastore mode

[Firestore in Datastore mode](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs) is a NoSQL document database built for automatic scaling, high performance, and ease of application development.

Firestore is the newest version of Datastore and introduces [several improvements over Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/firestore-or-datastore#in_native_mode). 

Existing Datastore users can access these improvements by creating a new Firestore in Datastore mode database instance. 

In the future, all existing Datastore databases will be [automatically upgraded to Firestore in Datastore mode](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/upgrade-to-firestore).

While the [Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs) mode interface has many of the same features as traditional databases, as a NoSQL database it differs from them in the way it describes relationships between data objects.

### Azure Cosmos DB

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft's proprietary globally-distributed, multi-model database service "for managing data at planet-scale". It is schema-agnostic, horizontally scalable and generally classified as a NoSQL database.

### Amazon DynamoDB

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed proprietary NoSQL database service that supports keyâ€“value and document data structures.  DynamoDB exposes a similar data model to and derives its name from Dynamo, but has a different underlying implementation. Dynamo had a multi-leader design requiring the client to resolve version conflicts and DynamoDB uses synchronous replication across multiple data centers for high durability and availability.  It is presented as a evolution of Amazon SimpleDB.
