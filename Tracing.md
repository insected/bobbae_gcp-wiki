[Cloud Trace](https://cloud.google.com/trace) is a distributed tracing system that collects latency data from your applications and displays it in the Google Cloud Console. [You can track](https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/quickstart) how requests propagate through your application and receive detailed near real-time performance insights. Cloud Trace automatically analyzes all of your application's traces to generate in-depth latency reports to surface performance degradations, and can capture traces from all of your VMs, containers, or App Engine projects.

Cloud Trace recommends using [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/). OpenTelemetry is an open-source product from the merger between [OpenCensus](https://opencensus.io/) and OpenTracing.

Cloud Trace [is part](Operations-and-Stackdriver) of [Google Cloud operations suite](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs).
