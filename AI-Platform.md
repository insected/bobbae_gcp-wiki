# AI Platform Deep Learning VM Images

Deep Learning VM images are Debian 9- and Debian 10-based Compute Engine virtual machine images optimized for data science and machine learning tasks. All images come with key ML frameworks and tools pre-installed, and can be used out of the box on instances with GPUs to accelerate your data processing tasks.
