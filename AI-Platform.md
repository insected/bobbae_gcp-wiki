Google's [Vertex AI](Vertex-AI ) is a unified [AI](AI) platform that brings [Google AutoML](AutoML) and [Google AI Platform](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/docs) together into a unified API, client library, and user interface. 


The [Google AI Platform](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/docs) provides integrated tool chain  that helps you build and run your own [machine learning](Machine-Learning) applications.

[Google Document AI](Document-AI) platform uses machine learning  to automatically classify, extract, and enrich data within your documents to unlock insights. 

[Google Contact Center AI](Contact-Center-AI)  helps users detect and visualize patterns in their contact center data. Understanding conversational data drives business value, improves operational efficiency, and provides a voice for customer feedback.
