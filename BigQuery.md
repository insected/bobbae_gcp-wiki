BigQuery is Google Cloud's fully managed, petabyte-scale, and cost-effective analytics data warehouse that lets you run analytics over vast amounts of data in near real time. With BigQuery, there's no infrastructure to set up or manage, letting you focus on finding meaningful insights using standard SQL and taking advantage of flexible pricing models across on-demand and flat-rate options.

##### Snowflake, Star, Galaxy

Star Schema in a data warehouse, in which the center of the star can have one fact table and a number of associated dimension tables. It is known as star schema as its structure resembles a star. The Star Schema data model is the simplest type of Data Warehouse schema. It is also known as Star Join Schema and is optimized for querying large data sets.

Snowflake Schema in a data warehouse is a logical arrangement of tables in a multidimensional database such that the [ER diagram](https://www.guru99.com/er-diagram-tutorial-dbms.html) resembles a snowflake shape. A Snowflake Schema is an extension of a Star Schema, and it adds additional dimensions. The dimension tables are normalized which splits data into additional tables.

A Galaxy Schema contains two fact table that share dimension tables between them. It is also called Fact Constellation Schema. The schema is viewed as a collection of stars hence the name Galaxy Schema.

##### Analyzing Natality Data Using AI Platform and BigQuery

A favorite lab.

This lab illustrates how you can carry out data exploration of large datasets, but continue to use familiar tools like Pandas and Jupyter. The trick is to do the first part of your aggregation in BigQuery, get back a Pandas DataFrame, then work with the smaller Pandas DataFrame locally. AI Platform provides a managed Jupyter experience, so you don't need to run notebook servers yourself.

### Weather data in BigQuery

A favorite lab.

This lab uses two public datasets in BigQuery: weather data from NOAA and citizen complaints data from New York City.  Interestingly, you will find what types of municipal complaints are correlated with weather. For example, you will find (not surprisingly) that complaints about residential furnaces are most common when it is cold outside.
