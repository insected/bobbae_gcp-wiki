If you want to get a well-rounded education in  Computer Science  there are many  [resources available](https://github.com/Developer-Y/cs-video-courses
).

Using a curated list of [free courses from reputable universities](https://github.com/ForrestKnight/open-source-cs) like MIT, Stanford, and Princeton you can get an undergraduate [Computer Science education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBSGKlAvoiM&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbn5emQ3RRG8gEBqkhf_5vxD
).


The [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) curriculum is a complete education in computer science using online materials. It's not merely for career training or professional development. It's for those who want a proper grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines, and for those who have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain this education largely on their own, but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners.

You can learn [Statistics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxpc-HPKN28&list=RDCMUC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ&index=7) and [data analytics](https://datacadamia.com/) as well as many related topics as listed below.

## Computer Science Ethics 



Computing professionals' actions change the world. To act responsibly, they should reflect upon the wider impacts of their work, consistently supporting the public good. The [ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct]( https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics ) ("the Code") expresses the conscience of the profession.

[Computer ethics]( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_ethics ) is a part of practical philosophy concerned with how computing professionals should make decisions regarding professional and social conduct.

[Algorithmic bias]( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias ) describes systematic and repeatable errors in a computer system that create unfair outcomes, such as privileging one arbitrary group of users over others. Bias can emerge due to many factors, including but not limited to the design of the algorithm or the unintended or unanticipated use or decisions relating to the way data is coded, collected, selected or used to train the algorithm.
