If you want to get a well-rounded education in Computer Science there are many  resources available for free.

## OSSU

The [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) curriculum is a complete education in computer science using online materials. It's not merely for career training or professional development. It's for those who want a proper grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines, and for those who have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain this education largely on their own, but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners.





## Opensource computer science degree 

This is a curated list of [free courses from reputable universities](https://github.com/ForrestKnight/open-source-cs) like MIT, Stanford, and Princeton that satisfy the same requirements as an undergraduate Computer Science degree, minus general education.
