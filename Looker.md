[Looker](  https://looker.com/ ) lets you describe their data using a modeling language called [LookML](LookML). 

[LookML](LookML ) tells Looker how to query data, so everyone in the organization can create easy-to-read [reports]( https://docs.looker.com/dashboards/dashboards-reports-intro   ) and [dashboards](   https://docs.looker.com/dashboards  ) to [explore](https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/learning-lookml/explore-menu-and-field-picker) patterns of data. Looker offers additional features for creating custom data applications and experiences.

Looker's platform works with transactional databases like Oracle and MySQL as well as analytical datastores like [BigQuery](BigQuery), [Snowflake](https://snowflake.com), [Redshift](  https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/   ), and more. Looker lets you create consistent data models on top of all your data with speed and accuracy. Looker offers a unified surface to access all of an organization's data.

Looker is a data aggregation tool in addition to dashboarding. It was built from the ground up to integrate a variety of data sources and allow for the flexibility to aggregate and transform data with LookML.

Looker also allows you to send data to other platforms through an [Application Programming Interface]( https://docs.looker.com/reference/api-and-integration   ) (API) and develop separate data services and products, proving there is much more you can do with the platform than just develop dashboards.
