### Cloud Healthcare API

The [Cloud Healthcare API](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs) provides industry-standard protocols and formats for ingesting, storing, analyzing, and integrating healthcare data with cloud-based applications.

The API supports the following applications:



*   Healthcare machine learning applications
*   Data-level integration of healthcare systems
*   Secure storage and retrieval of healthcare and life science data, including electronic protected health information (ePHI) and other forms of PII

For many applications, the Cloud Healthcare API can provide a cloud-based alternative to on-premises stacks implementing the following standards:



*   Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)
*   Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) DSTU2, STU3, and R4 standards
*   Health Level Seven Version 2.x (HL7v2)

The [Cloud Healthcare API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-yvlt5mVXk) simplifies data integration with existing systems and allows developers to focus on differentiating features, such as UX and intelligence.
