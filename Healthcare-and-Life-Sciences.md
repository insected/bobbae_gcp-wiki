### Cloud Healthcare API

The [Cloud Healthcare API](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs) provides industry-standard protocols and formats for ingesting, storing, analyzing, and integrating healthcare data with cloud-based applications.

The API supports the following applications:



*   Healthcare machine learning applications
*   Data-level integration of healthcare systems
*   Secure storage and retrieval of healthcare and life science data, including electronic protected health information (ePHI) and other forms of PII

For many applications, the Cloud Healthcare API can provide a cloud-based alternative to on-premises stacks implementing the following standards:



*   Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)
*   Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) DSTU2, STU3, and R4 standards
*   Health Level Seven Version 2.x (HL7v2)

The [Cloud Healthcare API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-yvlt5mVXk) simplifies data integration with existing systems and allows developers to focus on differentiating features, such as UX and intelligence.


There is no shortage of [opportunities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P54bm_TNnqQ) for [clinical decision support and cognitive assistance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DH-JC9DfYdI) in healthcare. 


### HIPAA

Google Cloud infrastructure provides reliable information security designed to meet or exceed the requirements of HIPAA and protected health information. Covered by our HIPAA Business Associates Agreement and available via FedRAMP ATO for the National Cancer Institute Cancer Cloud Pilots.

### Cloud Life Sciences

[Cloud Life Sciences](https://cloud.google.com/life-sciences) is [a suite of services](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0dhKfuhbVM) and tools for [managing, processing, and transforming life sciences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz93mfqQvYA) data. 

Cloud Life Sciences (formerly Google Genomics) enables the life sciences community to process biomedical data at scale. Cost effective and supported by a growing partner ecosystem, Cloud Life Sciences lets you focus on analyzing data and reproducing results while Google Cloud takes care of the rest.

It also enables [advanced insights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27tSivxnQ_E) and operational workflows using highly scalable and compliant infrastructure. [Cloud Life Sciences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_G_1SWVHgw) includes features such as the [Cloud Life Sciences API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQeh0l9lnfk) and extract-transform-load (ETL) [tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8RABR19n8Y), and [more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAAZNH-Wa6A).

### Deep Learning in Life Sciences

There are useful [courses](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLypiXJdtIca5ElZMWHl4HMeyle2AzUgVB) on Deep Learning in Sciences and [general bioinformatics](https://github.com/ossu/bioinformatics).

### Examples
#### Storing and loading genomic variants

[This page describes](https://cloud.google.com/life-sciences/docs/how-tos/load-variants) how to use the Variant Transforms tool to transform and load VCF files directly into [BigQuery](BigQuery) for large-scale analysis.


#### Large-scale bioinformatics in the cloud with GCP, Kubernetes and Snakemake

Perform a [large metagenomics sequencing experiment â€“ 96 10X Genomics linked read libraries sequenced across 25 lanes on a HiSeq4000](https://www.bsiranosian.com/bioinformatics/large-scale-bioinformatics-in-the-cloud-with-gcp-kubernetes-and-snakemake/) in GCP.


#### Tutorials for the ISB-CGC Google Cloud Engine


This [github repository](https://github.com/isb-cgc/RunningWorkflows-on-the-GoogleCloud) is  for the running workflows on the Google Cloud Platform for the ISB-CGC.  The documentation at http://isb-cancer-genomics-cloud.readthedocs.org.

This [Google genomics github account](https://github.com/googlegenomics) contains code samples and information about Google Life Sciences.
