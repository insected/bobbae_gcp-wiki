## Kubernetes

[Kubernetes](Kubernetes)  is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. 

## Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

[GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) is Secured and fully managed [Kubernetes](Kubernetes) service with revolutionary [autopilot](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/autopilot-overview) mode of operation.

## Examples

### GKE HA and Stateful Application, PVC

[Kubernetes](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/kubernetes-engine-overview) is a great tool to host your highly available applications but what happens when you have to work with [stateful workloads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRZtZX0PDFc)? 



### Batch on GKE

Batch on GKE (Batch) is a cloud-native solution for scheduling and managing batch workloads. With Batch, you can leverage the on-demand and flexible nature of cloud. Batch is based on Kubernetes and containers so your jobs are portable.

### Kubernetes applications on Google Cloud Marketplace

The Kubernetes apps in Cloud Marketplace include container images and configuration files, such as a kubectl configuration or a[ Helm chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/). When you deploy an app from Cloud Marketplace, the Kubernetes resources are created in your cluster, and you can manage the resources as a group.
