### Cloud Endpoints

[Endpoints](Endpoints) is an API management system that helps you secure, monitor, analyze, and set quotas on your APIs using the same infrastructure Google uses for its own APIs. After you deploy your API to Endpoints, you can use the [Cloud Endpoints Portal](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/dev-portal-overview) to create a developer portal, a website that users of your API can access to view documentation and interact with your API.


Use Cloud Endpoints to deploy, test and  manage your API’s.

### Cloud API

[Google Cloud APIs](https://cloud.google.com/apis) are a key part of Google Cloud Platform, allowing you to easily add the power of everything from storage access to machine-learning-based image analysis to your Cloud Platform applications.



### Artifact Registry

[Artifcat registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifacts/docs) is a universal package manager for all your build artifacts and dependencies. Fast, scalable, reliable and secure.


[Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs) has evolved into [Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifacts/docs)  - a platform that allows you to seamlessly manage container images, integrate with Cloud Build and third-party CI/CD systems.

### Container Registry

[Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs) provides secure, private Docker image storage on Google Cloud Platform.



### Cloud Source Repositories

Cloud Source Repositories are fully featured, private [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repositories hosted on Google Cloud.

### Cloud Deployment Manager


#### Introduction

Google Cloud Deployment Manager is an infrastructure deployment service that automates the creation and management of Google Cloud resources. Write flexible template and configuration files and use them to create deployments that have a variety of Google Cloud services, such as Cloud Storage, Compute Engine, and Cloud SQL, configured to work together.


Google Cloud Deployment Manager is supported along with Terraform in the Cloud  Foundation Toolkit as part of the framework for the [Infrastructure as Code](Infrastructure-as-code).

[https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs)


#### Tutorial

In this tutorial, you deploy an example logbook app that uses Node.js for its frontend and MySQL for its backend.

### Codelabs

Google Developers Codelabs provide a guided, tutorial, hands-on coding experience. Most codelabs will step you through the process of building a small application, or adding a new feature to an existing application. They cover a wide range of topics such as Android Wear, Google Compute Engine, Project Tango, and Google APIs on iOS.

### Colab

Colaboratory, or "Colab" for short, allows you to write and execute Python in your browser.

Colab allows you to not only execute Jupyter Notebooks on the web, but also offers a free GPU, excellent collaboration features, built-in code snippets, and more.

### Cloud Scheduler

Cloud Scheduler is a fully managed enterprise-grade cron job scheduler. It allows you to schedule virtually any job, including batch, big data jobs, cloud infrastructure operations, and more. You can automate everything, including retries in case of failure to reduce manual toil and intervention. Cloud Scheduler even acts as a single pane of glass, allowing you to manage all your automation tasks from one place.

[https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/quickstart)

Use Cloud Scheduler to run python scripts in the cloud periodically like cron jobs.

### Cloud Tasks

Cloud Tasks is a fully managed service that allows you to manage the execution, dispatch and delivery of a large number of distributed tasks. You can asynchronously perform work outside of a user request. Your tasks can be executed on App Engine or any arbitrary HTTP endpoint.

[https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs)

### Cloud Code

Cloud Code provides IDE support for the full development cycle of Kubernetes and Cloud Run applications, from creating and customizing a new application from sample templates to running your finished application. Cloud Code also supports you along the way with run-ready samples, out-of-the-box configuration snippets, and a tailored debugging experience — making developing with Kubernetes and Cloud Run a whole lot easier!

[https://cloud.google.com/code/docs](https://cloud.google.com/code/docs)

Cloud Code provides an end-to-end workflow for developing, debugging, and deploying Cloud Run applications from within IDEs such as Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ.

### Cloud Build

Cloud Build is a service that executes your builds on Google Cloud Platform infrastructure. Cloud Build can import source code from Google Cloud Storage, Cloud Source Repositories, GitHub, or Bitbucket, execute a build to your specifications, and produce artifacts such as Docker containers or Java archives.

[https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs)

Google Cloud Build helps you create fast, consistent, and reliable workflows.
