[Cloud NAT](https://cloud.google.com/nat) s a distributed, software-defined managed [Network Address Translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation) service. It's not based on proxy VMs or appliances. It is based on [Andromeda](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2014/04/enter-andromeda-zone-google-cloud-platforms-latest-networking-stack.html).   I can be used with [GCE](https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/gce-example) and [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/gke-example) services.
