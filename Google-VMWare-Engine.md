The [Google VMWare Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vmware-engine) service delivers a fully managed [VMware Cloud Foundation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/index.html) stack—VMware [vSphere](https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere.html), [vCenter](https://www.vmware.com/products/vcenter-server.html), [vSAN](https://www.vmware.com/products/vsan.html), [NSX-T](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/index.html), and [HCX](https://cloud.vmware.com/vmware-hcx) for cloud migration—in a dedicated environment on Google Cloud’s highly performant and reliable infrastructure to support enterprise production workloads. 


With this service, you can migrate or extend your on-premises workloads to Google Cloud in minutes by connecting to a dedicated VMware environment directly through the Google Cloud Console. This allows you to seamlessly migrate to the cloud without the cost or complexity of refactoring applications, and run and manage workloads consistently with your on-premises environment. 

By running your VMware workloads on Google Cloud, you reduce your operational burden while benefiting from scale and agility, and maintain continuity with your existing tools, policies, and processes.
