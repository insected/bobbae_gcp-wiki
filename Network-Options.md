Google's connectivity solutions enable you to connect your networks to Google in the following ways:

- To Google Cloud, which enables you to access your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks and Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instances from your on-premises networks or from another cloud provider.

- To connect your sites together through a Network Connectivity Center hub located in Google Cloud.

- To Google Workspace and supported Google APIs, which lets you access only these products and services.

- To CDN providers, which enables you to choose supported content delivery providers that establish Direct Peering links with Google's edge network. Choosing a provider enables you to send traffic from your VPC networks to that provider.
