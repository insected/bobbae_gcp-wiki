[Big data](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data) is a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically extract information from, or otherwise deal with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software. Data with many fields (columns) offer greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate.

[Big data](https://www.guru99.com/bigdata-tutorials.html) was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity. The analysis of big data presents challenges in sampling, and thus previously allowing for only observations and sampling. Therefore, big data often includes data with sizes that exceed the capacity of traditional software to process within an acceptable time and value.

Current usage of the term big data tends to refer to the use of predictive analytics, user behavior analytics, or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from big data, and seldom to a particular size of data set. 

The world's technological per-capita capacity to store information has roughly doubled every 40 months since the 1980s.

Based on an IDC report prediction, the global data volume was predicted to grow exponentially from 4.4 [zettabytes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte#Multiple-byte_units) to 44 zettabytes between 2013 and 2020. By 2025, IDC predicts there will be 163 zettabytes of data.
