[Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) is a secure and convenient storage system for API keys, passwords, certificates, and other sensitive data. 


## Concepts

Secret Manager works well for storing configuration information such as database passwords, API keys, or TLS certificates needed by an application at runtime.

A key management system, such as [Cloud KMS](Cloud-KMS), allows you to manage cryptographic keys and to use them to encrypt or decrypt data. However, you cannot view, extract, or export the key material itself.
