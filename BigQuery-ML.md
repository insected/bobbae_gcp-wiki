### Using AutoML Tables with BigQuery ML

[AutoML](AutoML) Tables let you build and deploy machine learning models using structured data and explain prediction results.
It can be used along with BigQuery ML. This makes it easy to train Tables models on BigQuery data using SQL from BigQuery UI and evaluate and use the models for prediction directly via SQL.

To train an AutoML Tables model inside of BigQuery, use the BigQuery ML CREATE MODEL statement with one of the AutoML Tables model types.
