### Anthos Deployments

GKE on-prem is hybrid cloud software that brings Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to on-premises data centers. GKE on-prem is a reliable, efficient, and secured way to run Kubernetes clusters anywhere.

### Anthos Config Management

Anthos Config Management is a key component of Anthos. With Anthos Config Management, you can create a common configuration across all your infrastructure, including custom policies, and apply it both on-premises and in the cloud. Anthos Config Management evaluates changes and rolls them out to all Kubernetes clusters so that your desired state is always reflected.

### Google Cloud Marketplace for Anthos

A Kubernetes app is a containerized application that you can run on your Kubernetes cluster. The Kubernetes apps in Cloud Marketplace include container images and configuration files, such as a kubectl configuration or a Helm chart. When you deploy an app from Cloud Marketplace, the Kubernetes resources are created in your cluster, and you can manage the resources as a group.
