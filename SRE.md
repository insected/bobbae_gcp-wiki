[SRE](https://sre.google/)  is what you get when you treat operations as if itâ€™s a software problem. 

Site reliability engineering (SRE) is a software engineering approach to IT operations. SRE teams use software as a tool to manage systems, solve problems, and automate operations tasks. ... In this way, SRE helps to improve the reliability of a system today, while also improving it as it grows over time.

[SRE](https://landing.google.com/sre/books/) [classroom](https://sre.google/classroom) is a collection of workshops developed by Google's Site Reliability Engineering group. The goals of this workshop are to (1) introduce participants to the principles of non-abstract large systems design (NALSD), and (2) provide hands-on experiences with applying these principles to the design and evaluation of these systems. We consider NALSD a concept fundamental to SRE, and understanding its principles provides a basis for having meaningful conversations about the design and operation of large software systems.
