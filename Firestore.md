[Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) is a NoSQL document database built for automatic scaling, high performance, and ease of application development. While the Firestore interface has many of the same features as traditional databases, as a NoSQL database it differs from them in the way it describes relationships between data objects.

## Deleting Firestore database

There's no way option to delete Firestore in Firebase UI, neither in Google Cloud. You can remove the whole project or let it be. You won't be billed for it if you don't use it.
