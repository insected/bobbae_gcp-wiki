## What is a container?

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

### Container Images

A container image is a ready-to-run software package, containing everything needed to run an application: the code and any runtime it requires, application and system libraries, and default values for any essential settings.

By design, a container is immutable: you cannot change the code of a container that is already running. If you have a containerized application and want to make changes, you need to build a new image that includes the change, then recreate the container to start from the updated image.

Container images use [Union Filesystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnionFS). In Linux, docker originally use AUFS but they use OverlayFS now.  The details of union filesystem use in docker container images can be found at https://martinheinz.dev/blog/44.


## Container runtimes

The container runtime is the software that is responsible for running containers.

Kubernetes supports several container runtimes: Docker, [containerd](https://containerd.io/), [CRI-O](https://cri-o.io), and any implementation of the Kubernetes CRI (Container Runtime Interface).


## Containers vs. VMs

Virtual machines and containers differ in several ways, but the primary difference is that containers provide a way to virtualize an OS so that multiple workloads can run on a single OS instance. With VMs, the hardware is being virtualized to run multiple OS instances. Containersâ€™ speed, agility, and portability make them yet another tool to help streamline software development.

## Three ways to run containers in GCP

Find out the top three ways you can run your containers on Google Cloud! Google Kubernetes Engine for a container orchestration solution, Cloud Run for a fully serverless approach and Compute Engine to simply use Virtual Machines.
