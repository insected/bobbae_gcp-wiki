## Compliance

GCP products regularly undergo [independent verification](https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance
) of their security, privacy, and compliance controls, achieving certifications, attestations, and audit reports to demonstrate compliance. There are  resource [documents and mappings for compliance](https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/compliance-reports-manager) support when formal certifications or attestations may not be required or applied.
