There are  resource [documents and mappings for compliance](https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/compliance-reports-manager) support when formal certifications or attestations may not be required or applied.

### Cloud Governance

[Cloud governance](cloud-governance) is a set of practices that help ensure users operate in the cloud in ways that they want, that the operations are efficient, and that the user can monitor and correct operations as needed.

### Data Governance 


[Data governance](data-governance) is a principled approach to manage data during its lifecycle â€” from acquisition, to use, to disposal.
