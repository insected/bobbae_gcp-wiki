### SQL vs NoSQL

Structured Query language (SQL) pronounced as "S-Q-L" or sometimes as "See-Quel" is the standard language for dealing with Relational Databases. A relational database defines relationships in the form of tables.

NoSQL is a non-relational DMS, that does not require a fixed schema, avoids joins, and is easy to scale. NoSQL database is used for distributed data stores with humongous data storage needs. NoSQL is used for Big data and real-time web apps. For example companies like Twitter, Facebook, Google that collect terabytes of user data every single day.
