gRPC is a technology for implementing RPC APIs that uses HTTP 2.0 as its underlying transport protocol. 

## REST

REST is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer. It is architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems and was first presented by Roy Fielding in 2000 in [his famous dissertation](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm).

The key abstraction of information in REST is a resource. Any information that can be named can be a resource: a document or image, a temporal service, a collection of other resources, a non-virtual object (e.g. a person), and so on. REST uses a resource identifier to identify the particular resource involved in an interaction between components.

## gRPC

A second model for using HTTP for APIs is illustrated by gRPC. gRPC uses HTTP/2 under the covers, but HTTP is not exposed to the API designer. gRPC-generated stubs and skeletons hide HTTP from the client and server too, so nobody has to worry how the RPC concepts are mapped to HTTPâ€”they just have to learn gRPC. 

The way a client uses a gRPC API is by following these three steps:

- Decide which procedure to call

- Calculate the parameter values to use (if any)

- Use a code-generated stub to make the call, passing the parameter values
