[Google Cloud Deployment Manager](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs) is an infrastructure deployment service that automates the creation and management of Google Cloud resources. Write flexible template and configuration files and use them to create deployments that have a variety of Google Cloud services, such as Cloud Storage, Compute Engine, and Cloud SQL, configured to work together.

Google Cloud Deployment Manager is supported along with Terraform in the [Cloud Foundation Toolkit](https://cloud.google.com/foundation-toolkit) as part of the framework for the [Infrastructure as Code](Infrastructure-as-code).

[Google Cloud Deployment Manager](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager) allows you to specify all the resources needed for your application in a declarative format using yaml. You can also use Python or Jinja2 templates to parameterize the configuration and allow reuse of common deployment paradigms such as a load balanced, auto-scaled instance group.
